NOTE: If this is a _discussion starter_, you need any _installation help_, or have a _question_ on how to accomplish something,
rather post at [our discussion channel](https://www.domjudge.org/chat) or send an email to our
[DOMjudge-devel mailinglist](https://www.domjudge.org/mailman/postorius/lists/domjudge-devel.domjudge.org/).

Thank you for suggesting ways to improve DOMjudge. Before you file a feature
request, it might be useful to discuss it first via the chat or mailing list
linked above. We can then assess together whether there is
not already a way to accomplish your goal with DOMjudge currently.
