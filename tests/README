Test sources for DOMjudge
=========================

This directory contains several sources to test the DOMjudge system
for correct functioning after installation. All sources are for
problems part of the default "Demo Contest", see the PDF files under
doc/examples for the problem descriptions.

These files test various parts of the system: mostly whether the
judging backend funtions correctly for all languages, but also whether
the submission system can handle some irregular cases.

To test the system, run 'make check'. This will try to submit all
sources (excluding the stress tests). For this to work the system
should be completely configured and the submit- and judgedaemons
running. The default contest 'Demo contest', problems 'Hello',
'Fltcmp', and 'Boolfind' can be used for testing. Files named
'test-hello.*' should give correct answers on problem 'Hello'; all
other files 'test-*' should fail for different reasons, which is
described in these files respectively. The files 'fltcmp-test-*' are
for problem 'Fltcmp' and files 'boolfind-test-*' for problem
'Boolfind' respectively. Zip files contain multifile submissions.

'make test-stress' will submit the stress tests, which may break the
system and require manual repair: be careful!

After running 'make check' you can either manually verify the results
or browse to the 'Judging verifier' page from the admin web-interface
to automatically verify the results using the '@EXPECTED_RESULTS@:'
header in the sources.
