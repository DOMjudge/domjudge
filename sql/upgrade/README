MySQL upgrade scripts
=====================

This directory contains MySQL upgrade scripts that can be applied to
upgrade the DOMjudge MySQL database structure and data to a newer
version.

These upgrade scripts have names 'upgrade_<from>_<to>.sql', with
<from> and <to> the respective versions of DOMjudge they apply to.
Each script contains a check that verifies if it should be applied and
which fails if the upgrade was applied already. The scripts should be
applied in order; this can be done manually - be sure to run them from
sql/ as the current working directory (not sql/upgrades/) - but it is
probably easier to use the command 'dj-setup-database upgrade'.

Upgrading to a new minor/major version is supported, but only to the
latest bugfix release in that series. For example, there is only one
upgrade script between versions 3.1.X and 3.2.Y and this will be
between the latest two bugfix releases of both series. The upgrade
scripts between the different 3.1.X bugfix releases are also present,
so this gives a unique upgrade path: first to the latest bugfix
release in the current series, then to the latest bugfix release in
the newer series. (Note that all SQL upgrade scripts are shipped, so
one does not need to install these intermediate versions of DOMjudge.)
