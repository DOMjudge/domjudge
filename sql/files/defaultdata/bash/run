# Bash shell compile wrapper-script for 'compile.sh'.
# See that script for syntax and more info.
#
# This script does not actually "compile" the source, but writes a
# shell script that will function as the executable: when called, it
# will execute the source with the correct interpreter syntax, thus
# allowing this interpreted source to be used transparantly as if it
# was compiled to a standalone binary.
#
# NOTICE: this compiler script cannot be used with the USE_CHROOT
# configuration option turned on unless proper preconfiguration of
# the chroot environment has been taken care of.
# By default the bash executable is located in /bin/bash, which
# doesn't get included by the shipped chroot-startstop.sh script.
# Thus, besides installing bash in the chroot environment, it should
# (for example) be copied to /usr/bin/bash.
