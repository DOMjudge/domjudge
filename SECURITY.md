## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please provide a PR to fix the vulnerability when possible without affecting the supported PHP versions.
If this is not possible please send us an email at team@domjudge.org, or contact us at Slack (see https://www.domjudge.org/chat)

We try to keep you updated at least once a month in case of larger vulnerabilities.
