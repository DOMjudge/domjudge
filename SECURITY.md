## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a vulnerability, please do not use the issue tracker
or pull request, but instead contact security@domjudge.org so we can assess
the issue and publish a fix when making it public.

Please mention the affected DOMjudge version and details of the vulnerability
and how to reproduce it. We promise to publicly disclose the reported
vulnerability, with the appropriate credit if desired, when we've agreed
on a proper way to solve it. We try to keep you updated at least once a
month in case of more complex vulnerabilities.
