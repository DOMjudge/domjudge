This is the Programming Contest Jury System "DOMjudge" version 8.1.3

DOMjudge is a system for running a programming contest, like the
ICPC regional and world championship programming contests.


Documentation
-------------

For more information on installation and requirements see the
documentation under the doc/manual directory. There is an HTML
version of the documentation available, prebuilt from reStructuredText
sources.

There's also team documentation available, prebuilt in PDF format from
reStructuredText sources, but it contains default/example settings.
To include the correct settings for your local environment, DOMjudge
has to be properly configured first, as parts of the configuration are
used in it (e.g. the URL to the team interface of DOMjudge). For more
information, see the documentation.

All documentation is also available online at the DOMjudge homepage:
	https://www.domjudge.org/documentation
Please note that this documentation is from the latest stable
release and thus might not apply to your version.

A fresh copy of the repository source tree must first be bootstrapped,
generating the configure script and documentation. This can be done
by running 'make dist', see the online documentation, section
"Developer information" for more details.

There is a wiki which collects other pieces of information about
specific configurations or integrations:
