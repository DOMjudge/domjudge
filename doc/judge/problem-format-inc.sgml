DOMjudge supports the import and export of problems in a zip-bundle
format. This zip file contains the following files in its base
directory:
<descrip>
<tag><tt>domjudge-problem.ini</tt></tag>

This file has a simple INI-syntax and contains problem metadata, see
below.

<tag><tt>&lt;testdata-file&gt;.in</tt> / <tt>&lt;testdata-file&gt;.out</tt></tag>

Each pair of <tt>&lt;testdata-file&gt;.{in,out}</tt> contains the
input and correct/reference output for a single test case. Single
files without their corresponding <tt>in</tt> or <tt>out</tt>
counterpart are ignored.

<tag><tt>&lt;solution&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;</tt></tag>

Submits code of reference solution as team DOMjudge if &lt;ext&gt; is a known
language extension. The contest, the problem, and the language have to be
enabled. The contest must be started. If you include an comment starting with
'<tt>@EXPECTED_RESULTS@: </tt>' followed by the possible outcomes, you can use
the <i>judging verifier</i> in the admin interface to verify the results.

</descrip>
When importing a zip file into DOMjudge, any other files are ignored.

<p>
The file <tt>domjudge-problem.ini</tt> contains key-value pairs, one
pair per line, of the form <tt>key = value</tt>. The <tt>=</tt> can
optionally be surrounded by whitespace and the value may be quoted,
which allows it to contain newlines. The following keys are supported
(these correspond directly to the problem settings in the jury web
interface):
<itemize>
<item><tt>probid</tt> - the problem identifier
<item><tt>cid</tt> - the associated contest identifier
<item><tt>name</tt> - the problem displayed name
<item><tt>allow_submit</tt> - allow submissions to this problem,
disabling this also makes the problem invisible to teams and public
<item><tt>allow_judge</tt> - allow judging of this problem
<item><tt>timelimit</tt> - time limit in seconds per test case
<item><tt>special_run</tt> - suffix tag of a special run script
<item><tt>special_compare</tt> - suffix tag of a special compare script
<item><tt>color</tt> - CSS color specification for this problem
</itemize>

The <tt>probid</tt> key is required when importing a new problem from
the <tt>jury/problems.php</tt> overview page, while it is ignored when
uploading into an existing problem. All other keys are optional. If
they are present, the respective value will be overwritten; if not
present, then the value will not be changed or a default chosen when
creating a new problem. Test data files are added to set of of test
cases already present. Thus, one can easily add test cases to a
configured problem by uploading a zip file that contains only
<tt>*.{in,out}</tt> files.
