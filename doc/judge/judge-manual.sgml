This document provides information about DOMjudge aimed at a jury
member operating the system during the contest: viewing and checking
submissions and working with clarification requests.

A separate manual is available for teams and administrators.

<chapt>General
<p>
The jury interface is accessed through a web browser. The main page
shows a list of various overviews, and the most important of those are
also included in the menu bar at the top. The menu bar will refresh
occasionally to allow for new information to be presented. It also has
the current `official' contest time in the top-right corner.

Most pieces of information are clickable and bring up a new page with
details. Many items also have tooltips that reveal extra information
when the mouse is hovered over them. Problem, language and team pages
have lists with corresponding submissions for that problem, language
or team. Tables can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.

The most important pages are `Submissions': the list of submitted
solutions made by teams, sorted by newest first, and `Scoreboard': the
canonical overview of current standings.

<sect>Judges and Administrators
<p>
The DOMjudge system discerns between <em>judges</em> and
<em>administrators</em> (admins). An administrator is responsible for
the technical side of DOMjudge: installation and keeping it running.
The jury web interface may be used by both, but depending on your
assigned role you may have more options.

<sect>Scoreboard
<p>
The scoreboard is the most important view on the contest.

The scoreboard will display an upcoming contest from the given
`activatetime'; the contest name and a countdown timer is shown. Only
at the first second of the real start of the contest it will show the
problems to the teams and public, however. The jury always has a full
view on the scoreboard.

It is possible to freeze the scoreboard at a given time, commonly
one hour before the contest ends, to keep that last hour interesting
for all. From that time on, the public and team scoreboard will not
be updated anymore (the jury scoreboard will) and indicate that they
are frozen. It will be unfrozen at a specified time, or by a button
click in the jury interface. Note that the way freezing works, a
submission from before the freeze and judged after may still update
the scoreboard even when frozen.

The problem headings can display the colours of balloons associated with
them, when set.

Nearly everything on the scoreboard can be clicked to reveal more
detailed information about the item in question: team names, specific
submissions and problem headers. Many cells will show additional
`title text' information when hovering over them. The score column
lists the number of solved problems and the total penalty time for
each team. Each cell in a problem column lists the number of
submissions, and if the problem was solved, this is followed by
the time of the first correct submission in minutes since contest
start. Any penalty time incurred for previous incorrect submissions is
included in the team's total time.

<chapt>Before the contest
<p>

Before the contest starts, a number of things will need to be
configured by the administrator. You can check that information,
such as the problem set(s), test data and time limits, contest
start- and end time, the time at which the scoreboard will be
frozen and unfrozen, all from the links from the front page.

Note that multiple contests can be defined, with corresponding
problem sets, for example a practice session and the real contest.

<sect>Problems and languages
<p>

The problem sets are listed under `Problems'. It is possible to change
whether teams can submit solutions for that problem (using the toggle
switch `allow submit'). If disallowed, submissions for that problem
will be rejected, but more importantly, teams will not see that
problem on the scoreboard. Disallow judge will make DOMjudge accept
submissions, but leave them queued; this is useful in case an
unexpected problem shows up with one of the problems. Timelimit is the
maximum number of seconds a submission for this problem is allowed to
run before a `TIMELIMIT' response is given (to be multiplied possibly
by a language factor). A `timelimit overshoot' can be
configured to let submissions run a bit longer. Although DOMjudge will
use the actual limit to determine the verdict, this allows judges to
see if a submission is close to the timelimit.

Problems can be imported and exported into and from DOMjudge
using zip-files that contain the problem metadata and testdata files,
based on the <tt>problemarchive.org</tt> format.
See appendix <ref id="problem-format" name="Problem package format
-specification"> for details.
Problems can have special <em>compare</em> and
<em>run</em> scripts associated to them, to deal with problem
statements that require non-standard evaluation. For more details see
the administrator's manual.

The `Languages' overview is quite the same. It has a timefactor
column; submissions in a language that has time factor 2 will be
allowed to run twice the time that has been specified under Problems.
This can be used to compensate for the execution speed of a language.

<sect>Verifying testdata
<p>

For checking whether your testdata conforms to the specifications
of your problem statement, we recommend the checktestdata program,
which is available from a <htmlurl name="separate repository"
url="https://github.com/DOMjudge/checktestdata">.
It allows you to not only check on simple (spacing) layout errors, but
a simple grammar file must be specified for the testdata, according to
which the testdata is checked. This allows e.g. for bounds checking.

This program is built upon the separate library <tt>libchecktestdata.h</tt>
that can be used to write the syntax checking part of special
compare scripts: it can easily handle the tedious task of verifying
that a team's submission output is syntactically valid, leaving just
the task of semantic validation to another program.

<sect>Testing jury solutions
<p>

Before a contest, you will want to have tested your reference
solutions on the system to see whether those are judged as expected
and maybe use their runtimes to set timelimits for the problems.

The simplest way to do this is to include the jury solutions in a
problem zip file and upload this. You can also upload a zip file
containing just solutions to an existing problem. Note that the zip
archive has to adhere to the <htmlurl name="Kattis problem package format"
url="http://www.problemarchive.org/wiki/index.php/Problem_Format">.
For this to work, the jury/admin who uploads the problem has to have
an associated team to which the solutions will be assigned. The
solutions will automatically be judged if the contest is active (but
it need not have started yet). You can verify whether the submissions
gave the expected answer from the link on the jury/admin index page.

<sect>Practice Session
<p>

If your contest has a test session or practice contest, use it also as
a general rehearsal of the jury system: judge test submissions as you
would do during the real contest and answer incoming clarification
requests.


<chapt>During the contest
<p>

<sect>Monitor teams
<p>
Under the Teams menu option, you can get a general impression of the
status of each team: a traffic light will show either of the
following:
<descrip>
<tag>gray  </tag>the team has not (yet) connected to the web interface at all;
<tag>red   </tag>the team has connected but not submitted anything yet;
<tag>yellow</tag>one or more submissions have been made, but none correct;
<tag>green </tag>the team has made at least one submission that has
                 been judged as correct.
</descrip>

This is especially useful during the practice session, where it is
expected that every team can make at least one correct submission. A
team with any other colour than green near the end of the session
might be having difficulties.


<sect>Judging Submissions
<p>

<sect1>Flow of submitted solutions
<p>

The flow of an incoming submission is as follows.

<enum>
<item>Team submits solution. It will either be rejected after basic
      checks, or accepted and stored as a <em>submission</em>.
<item>The first available <em>judgehost</em> compiles, runs and checks
      the submission. The outcome and outputs are stored as a
      <em>judging</em> of this submission. Note that judgehosts may be
      restricted to certain contests, languages and problems, so that it can be
      the case that a judgehost is available, but not judging an available
      submission.
<item>If verification is not required, the result is automatically
      recorded and the team can view the result and the scoreboard is
      updated (unless after the scoreboard freeze). A judge can
      optionally inspect the submission and judging and mark it
      verified.
<item>If verification is required, a judge inspects the judging. Only
      after it has been approved (marked as <em>verified</em>) will
      the result be visible outside the jury interface. This option
      can be enabled by setting <tt>verification_required</tt> on
      the <em>configuration settings</em> admin page.
</enum>

<sect1>Submission judging status codes
<p>
The interface for jury and teams shows the status of a submission with
a code.
<descrip>
<tag>QUEUED/PENDING</tag>submission received and awaiting a judgehost to process it *;
<tag>JUDGING       </tag>a judgehost is currently compiling/running/testing the submission *;
<tag>TOO-LATE      </tag>submission submitted after the contest ended;
<tag>CORRECT       </tag>submission correct, problem solved;
<tag>COMPILER-ERROR</tag>the compiler gave an error while compiling the program;
<tag>TIMELIMIT     </tag>program execution time exceeded the time defined for the problem;
<tag>RUN-ERROR     </tag>a kind of problem while running the program occurred, for example
                         segmentation fault, division by zero or exitcode unequal to 0;
<tag>NO-OUTPUT     </tag>there was no output at all from the program;
<tag>WRONG-ANSWER  </tag>the output of the program did not exactly match the expected output;
</descrip>
* in the team interface a submission will only show as PENDING to
prevent leaking information of problem time limits. The jury can see
whether a submission is QUEUED or JUDGING. In case of required
verification, a submission will show as PENDING to the team until the
judging has been verified.

Under the Submissions menu, you can see submitted solutions, with
the newest one at the top. Click on a submission line
for more details about the submission (team name, submittime etc),
a list of judgings and the details for the most recent judging
(runtime, outputs, diff with testdata). There is also a switch
available between newest 50, only unverified, only unjudged or
all submissions. The default (coloured) diff output shows differences
on numbered lines side by side separated by a character indicating how
the lines differ: <bf><tt>!</tt></bf> for different contents,
<bf><tt>$</tt></bf> for different or missing end-of-line characters,
and one of <bf><tt>&lt;&gt;</tt></bf> when there are no more lines at
the end of the other file.

Under the submission details the `view source code' link can be
clicked to inspect the source code. If the team has submitted code
in the same language for this problem before, a diff output between
the current and previous submission is also available there.

It is possible to edit the source code and resubmit it if you have a
team associated to your user. This does not have any effect for the
teams, but allows a judge to perform a `what if this was
changed'-analysis.

A submission can have multiple judgings, but only one valid judging at
any time. Multiple judgings occur when rejudging, see <ref
id="rejudging" name="Rejudging">.

<sect1>Rejudging <label id="rejudging">
<p>
In some situations it is necessary to rejudge one or more submissions. This means
that the submission will re-enter the flow as if it had not been
judged before. The submittime will be the original time, but the
program will be compiled, run and tested again.

This can be useful when there was some kind of problem: a compiler
that was broken and later fixed, or testdata that was incorrect and
later changed. When a submission is rejudged, the old judging data is
kept but marked as `invalid'.

You can rejudge a single submission by pressing the `Rejudge' button
when viewing the submission details. It is also possible to rejudge
all submissions for a given language, problem, team or judgehost; to
do so, go to the page of the respective language, problem, team or
judgehost, press the `Rejudge all' button and confirm.

There are two different ways to run a rejudging, depending on whether
the <tt>create rejudging</tt> button toggled:
<enum>
<item>Without this button toggled, an instant rejudging is
  performed where the results are directly made effective.
<item>When toggled, a "rejudging" set is created, and all affected
  submissions are rejudged, but the new judgings are not made
  effective yet. Instead, the jury can inspect the results of the
  rejudging (under the rejudging tab). Based on that the whole
  rejudging, as a set, can be applied or cancelled, keeping the old
  judgings as is.
</enum>

Submissions that have been marked as `CORRECT' will not be rejudged.
Only DOMjudge admins can override this restriction using a tickbox.

Teams will not get explicit notifications of rejudgings, other than a
potentially changed outcome of their submissions. It might be desirable
to combine rejudging with a clarification to the team or all teams
explaining what has been rejudged and why.

<sect1>Ignored submissions
<p>
Finally, there is the option to <em>ignore</em> specific submissions
using the button on the submission page. When a submission is being
ignored, it is as if was never submitted: it will show strike-through
in the jury's and affected team's submission list, and it is not
visible on the scoreboard. This can be used to effectively
delete a submission for some reason, e.g. when a team erroneously sent
it for the wrong problem. The submission can also be unignored again.

<sect>Clarification Requests
<p>
Communication between teams and jury happens through Clarification
Requests. Everything related to that is handled under the
Clarifications menu item.

<p>
Teams can use their web interface to send a clarification request to
the jury. The jury can send a response to that team specifically, or
send it to all teams. The latter is done to ensure that all teams have
the same information about the problem set. The jury can also send a
clarification that does not correspond to a specific request. These
will be termed `general clarifications'.

<p>
Under Clarifications, three lists are shown: new clarifications,
answered clarifications and general clarifications. It lists the team
login, the problem concerned, the time and an excerpt. Click the excerpt
for details about that clarification request.

<p>
Every incoming clarification request will initially be marked as
unanswered. The menu bar shows the number of unanswered requests. A
request will be marked as answered when a response has been sent.
Additionally it's possible to mark a clarification request as answered
with the button that can be found when viewing the request. The latter
can be used when the request has been dealt with in some other way,
for example by sending a general message to all teams.

<p>
An answer to a clarification request is made by putting the text in the
input box under the request text. The original text is quoted. You can
choose to either send it to the team that requested the clarification,
or to all teams. In the latter case, make sure you phrase it in such a
way that the message is self-contained (e.g. by keeping the quoted
text), since the other teams cannot view the original request.

<p>
The menu on every page of the jury interface will show the number
of unanswered clarification requests in a blue badge. This number is
automatically updated, even without reloading the page.


<chapt>After the contest
<p>
Once the contest is over, the system will still accept submissions but
these will receive the verdict `TOO-LATE'. These submissions will
still be judged and can be inspected by the jury, but they will not
affect scoring and none of the judging details will be visible to the
teams.

<p>
If the scoreboard was frozen, it will remain frozen until the time set
as unfreeze time, as seen under Contests. It is possible to publish
the final standings at any given moment by pressing the `unfreeze
now' button under contests.

<p>
There's not much more to be done after the contest has ended. The
administrator will need to take care of backing up all system data and
submissions, and the awards ceremony can start.

<appendix>

<chapt>Problem package format
<label id="problem-format">
<p>
DOMjudge supports the import and export of problems in a zip-bundle
format.

<p>
The base of the format is Problem Format specification at
<htmlurl name="problemformat.org"
url="http://www.problemarchive.org/wiki/index.php/Problem_Format">.
Please refer to that for the base specifications.

On top, DOMjudge defines a few extensions:
<itemize>
<item><tt>domjudge-problem.ini</tt> (required): metadata file, see below.
<item><tt>problem.{pdf,html,txt}</tt> (optional): problem statements as
distributed to participants. The file extension determines any of three
supported formats. If multiple files matching this pattern are
available, any one of those will be used.
</itemize>

<p>
The file <tt>domjudge-problem.ini</tt> contains key-value pairs, one
pair per line, of the form <tt>key = value</tt>. The <tt>=</tt> can
optionally be surrounded by whitespace and the value may be quoted,
which allows it to contain newlines. The following keys are supported
(these correspond directly to the problem settings in the jury web
interface):
<itemize>
<item><tt>name</tt> - the problem displayed name
<item><tt>allow_submit</tt> - allow submissions to this problem,
disabling this also makes the problem invisible to teams and public
<item><tt>allow_judge</tt> - allow judging of this problem
<item><tt>timelimit</tt> - time limit in seconds per test case
<item><tt>special_run</tt> - executable id of a special run script
<item><tt>special_compare</tt> - executable id of a special compare script
<item><tt>points</tt> - number of points for this problem (defaults to 1)
<item><tt>color</tt> - CSS color specification for this problem
</itemize>

<p>
The basename of the ZIP-file will be used as the problem short name(e.g. "A").
All keys are optional. If they are present, the respective value will be
overwritten; if not present, then the value will not be changed or a
default chosen when creating a new problem. Test data files are added to set
of test cases already present. Thus, one can easily add test cases to a
configured problem by uploading a zip file that contains only
testcase files. Any jury solutions present will be automatically
submitted when <tt>allow_submit</tt> is <tt>1</tt>.
