<chapt>DOMjudge overview <label id="overview">
<p>

DOMjudge is a system for running programming contests like the ACM
regional and world championship programming contests.

This means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly
5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 6-10).
Problems are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed
languages, that reads input according to the problem input
specification and writes the correct, corresponding output.

The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to
the jury. There the jury system compiles and runs the program and
compares the program output with the expected output.

This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during
such contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication
on problems (clarification requests). It has web interfaces for the
jury, the teams (their submissions and clarification requests) and the
public (scoreboard).

<sect1>About the name and logo
<p>

The name of this judging system is inspired by a very important and
well known landmark in the city of Utrecht: the dome tower, called the
`Dom' in Dutch. The logo of the 2004 Dutch Programming
Championships (for which this system was originally developed) depicts
a representation of the Dom in zeros and ones. We based the name and
logo of DOMjudge on that.

We would like to thank Erik van Sebille, the original creator of the
logo. The logo is under a GPL licence, but Erik suggested a "free as
in beer" licence first: you're allowed to use it, but you owe Erik a
free beer in case might you encounter him.

<chapt>Installation and configuration <label id="install_config">
<p>
This chapter details a fresh installation of DOMjudge. The first
section is a Quick Installation Reference, but that should only be
used by those already acquainted with the system. A detailed guide
follows after that.


<sect>Quick installation
<p>
<em>Note:</em> this is not a replacement for the thorough installation
instructions below, but more a cheat-sheet for those who've already
installed DOMjudge before and need a few hints. When in doubt, always
consult the full installation instruction.


External software:
<itemize>
<item> Install the MySQL-server, set a root password for it and
       make it accessible from all judgehosts.
<item> Install Apache, PHP and (recommended) phpMyAdmin.
<item> Make sure PHP works for the web server and command line scripts.
<item> Install necessary compilers on the judgehosts.
<item> See also <ref id="install_config:apt-getinstall"
       name="an example command line for Debian GNU/Linux">.
</itemize>

DOMjudge:
<itemize>
<item> Extract the source tarball and run <tt>./configure
       [--enable-fhs] --prefix=&lt;basepath&gt;</tt>.
<item> Run <tt>make domserver judgehost docs</tt> or just those
       targets you want installed on the current host.
<item> Run <tt>make install-{domserver,judgehost,docs}</tt>
       as root to install the system.
</itemize>
On the domserver host:
<itemize>
<item> Install the MySQL database using <tt>bin/dj-setup-database -u root -r
       install</tt> on the domserver host.
<item> Add <tt>etc/apache.conf</tt> to your Apache configuration, edit
       it to your needs, reload web server:
       <tt>
       sudo ln -s .../domserver/etc/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/domjudge.conf &&
       sudo apache2ctl graceful
       </tt>


<item> Check that the web interface works (/team, /public and /jury)
       and check that the jury interface is password protected.
       Add individual user accounts for jury members to <tt>etc/htpasswd-jury</tt>.
<item> Add useful contest data through the jury web interface or with
       phpMyAdmin.
<item> Run the config checker in the jury web interface.
</itemize>
On the judgehosts:
<itemize>
<!-- NOTE: update this, then also update the copy of this under chapter 2.14 -->
<item> RedHat: <tt>useradd -d /nonexistent -g nobody -M -n -s /bin/false domjudge-run</tt><newline>
       Debian: <tt>useradd -d /nonexistent -g nogroup -s /bin/false domjudge-run</tt><newline>
       (check specific options of useradd, since these vary per system)
<item> Add to <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt> or <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> the
       sudoers configuration as in <tt>etc/sudoers-domjudge</tt>.
<item> Copy the file <tt>etc/dbpasswords.secret</tt> from the
       domserver to all judgehosts to synchronise database passwords.
<item> Start the judge daemon: <tt>bin/judgedaemon</tt>
</itemize>
It should be done by now. As a check that (almost) everything works,
the set of test sources can be submitted:
<code>
cd tests
make check
</code>
Then, in the main jury web interface, select the admin link
<it>judging verifier</it> to automatically verify most of the
test sources, except for a few with multiple possible outcomes; these
have to be verified by hand. Read the test sources for a description of
what should (not) happen.
You may want to change the <tt>AUTH_METHOD</tt> to <tt>FIXED</tt> and set the
environment variable <tt>SUBMITBASEURL</tt> to your DOMjudge base URL, e.g.
<tt>http://domjudge.example.com/</tt>.

Optionally:
<itemize>
<item> Install the submit client on the team workstations.
<item> Generate one-time passwords for all the teams in the web interface.
<item> Further tighten the security of the system, e.g. by applying
       firewall rules.
<item> Start the balloon notification daemon: <tt>cd bin; ./balloons</tt>;
       or use the balloon web interface.
<item> Setup the Java chroot environment on the judgehosts to use Java with chroot:<newline>
       <tt>bin/dj_make_chroot &lt;chrootdir&gt; &lt;architecture&gt;</tt><newline>
       <tt>$EDITOR lib/judge/chroot-startstop.sh</tt><newline>
       enable the <tt>chroot-startstop.sh</tt> script in <tt>etc/judgehost-config.php</tt>
       and add <tt>etc/sudoers-domjudge</tt> to <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt> or
       <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt>. 

<item> For additional features in the jury web interface, the
       following PHP extensions can be installed:
       <itemize>
       <item>xdiff PECL extension for diffs between submissions;
       <item>zip PHP-bundled extension (<tt>--enable-zip</tt>)
             for uploading problem data as zip-bundles (enabled
             by default in Debian, but not in all other Linux
             distributions).
       </itemize>
</itemize>


<sect>Concepts
<p>

This manual assumes you are aware of some of the concepts used within
DOMjudge. Here's an overview.

DOMjudge discerns three different kinds of hosts:
<descrip>
<tag>Team computer</tag>
       Workstation for a team, where they develop their
       solutions and from which they submit them to the jury system.
       The only part of DOMjudge that runs here is the optional
       command line submit client; all other interaction by teams is
       done with a browser via the web interface.
<tag>DOMjudge server</tag>
       A host that receives the submissions, runs the
       database and serves the web pages. This host will run Apache,
       and MySQL. Optionally
       these tasks can be further split out to separate machines, but
       that's normally not necessary and not supported out of the box.
       Also called domserver for brevity.
<tag>Judgehosts</tag>
       A number of hosts, at least one, that will retrieve
       submitted solutions from the DOMjudge server, compile and run
       them and send the results back to the server. Since this
       is computationally intensive, there should ideally be at least
       a couple of these. They will run the judgedaemon from DOMjudge.
       For security and performance reasons it is highly recommended not
       to use the server as a judgehost.
</descrip>

Note that the judges (persons) are not required and not recommended to
work on any of the DOMjudge server or judgehosts. They can just access
the system via the jury web interface and working e.g. on judgehosts
can interfere with system stability.

<sect>Requirements
<label id="install_config:requirements">
<p>

<sect1>System requirements
<p>

The requirements for the deployment of DOMjudge are:

<itemize>
<item> Computers for the domserver and judgehosts must run Linux or a
       Unix variant. This software has been developed mostly under
       Debian GNU/Linux, and the manual adds some specific hints for
       that, which also apply to Debian derivative distributions like Ubuntu.
       DOMjudge has been tested a bit under other Linux
       distributions and FreeBSD. We try to adhere to POSIX standards.

<item> (Local) root access on the domserver and judgehosts for configuring sudo,
       installing some files with restricted permissions
       and for (un)mounting the proc file system when using Oracle (previously Sun) Java.
       See <ref id="security:rootprivs" name="Security: root privileges">
       for more details.

<item> A TCP/IP network which connects all DOMjudge and team computers.
       Extra network security which restricts internet access and
       access to other services (ssh, mail, talk, etc..) is advisable,
       but not provided by this software, see <ref
       id="security:external" name="Security: external security"> for
       more details. TCP/IP networking is used in a few different ways:
  <itemize>
  <item> The judgehosts use TCP/IP connections to connect to the
         MySQL database on port 3306.
  <item> HTTP traffic from teams, the public and jury to the web server,
         port 80 or 443.
  <item> The `submit' command line client connects to the web server also
         via HTTP.
  </itemize>
       When using the IP_ADDRESS authentication scheme, then each team
       computer needs to have a unique IP address from the view of the
       DOMjudge server, see <ref id="contestsetup:authentication"
       name="Contest setup: team authentication"> for more details.
</itemize>

<sect1>Software requirements
<p>

The following software is required for running DOMjudge.
<itemize>
<item> For every supported programming language a compiler is needed;
       preferably one that can generate statically linked stand-alone
       executables.

<item> Apache web server with support for PHP &gt;= 5.2.0 and the mysql
       extension for PHP. We also recommend the posix extension for extra
       debugging information.

<item> MySQL &gt;= 4.1.x database and client software

<item> PHP &gt;= 5.2.0 command line interface and the mysql extension.

<item> A POSIX compliant shell in <tt>/bin/sh</tt> (e.g. bash or ash)

<item> A statically compiled POSIX shell, located in
       <tt>lib/judge/sh-static</tt> (dash is included for Linux IA32)

<item> A lot of standard (GNU) programs, a probably incomplete list:
       hostname, date, dirname, basename, touch, chmod, cp, mv, cat,
       grep, diff, wc, mkdir, mkfifo, mount, sleep, head, tail, pgrep

<item> sudo to gain root privileges

<item> Apache htpasswd

<item> <htmlurl name="xsltproc" url="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/index.html"> 
       from the GNOME XSLT library package.

<item> A LaTeX installation to regenerate the team PDF-manual with
       site specific configuration settings included.
</itemize>

The following items are optional, but may be required to use certain
functionality.
<itemize>

<item> <htmlurl name="phpMyAdmin" url="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">,
       to be able to access the database in an emergency
       or for data import/export

<item> An NTP daemon (for keeping the clocks between jury
       system and judgehosts in sync)

<item> <htmlurl name="libcurl" url="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">~
       (to use the command line submit client with the web interface)

<item> <htmlurl name="libmagic" url="http://www.darwinsys.com/file/">~
       (for command line submit client to detect binary file submissions)

<item> <htmlurl name="PECL xdiff extension"
        url="http://pecl.php.net/package/xdiff">~
       (to reliably make diffs between submissions, DOMjudge will try
        alternative approaches if it's not available)

<item> <htmlurl name="PHP zip Extension"
        url="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php">~
       (to upload problem data via zip bundles)

<item> <htmlurl name="beep" url="http://www.johnath.com/beep/"> for
       audible notification of errors, submissions and judgings, when
       using the default <tt>alert</tt> script.
</itemize>

Software required for building DOMjudge:
<itemize>
<item> gcc and g++ with standard libraries. Other compilers and
       libraries might also work: we have successfully compiled
       DOMjudge sources with <htmlurl name="Clang"
       url="http://clang.llvm.org/"> from the LLVM project; the C
       library should support the POSIX.1-2008 specification.

<item> GNU make

<item> The <htmlurl name="Boost" url="http://www.boost.org/">
       <htmlurl name="regular expression library"
        url="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/regex/"> and
       the GNU <htmlurl name="Multiple Precision library"
       url="http://gmplib.org/"> to build the <tt>checktestdata</tt>
       program for advanced checking of input/output data correctness.
       These are optional and can be disabled with the configure
       option <tt>--disable-checktestdata</tt>.
</itemize>

<sect1>Requirements for team workstations
<p>

In the most basic setup the team workstations only need (next to the tools needed
for program development) a web browser. The web interface fully works with any
known browser. With JavaScript disabled, all basic functionality remains working,
with the notable exception of multiple file submissions and some convenience
functions.

<label id="install_config:apt-getinstall">
<sect1>Debian installation command
<p>

For your convenience, the following command will install needed
software on the DOMjudge server as mentioned above when using Debian
GNU/Linux, or one of its derivate distributions like Ubuntu.

<code>
apt-get install gcc g++ make libcurl4-gnutls-dev mysql-server \
	apache2 php5 php5-cli libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql php-geshi \
	ntp sudo procps sharutils \
	phpmyadmin xsltproc libboost-regex-dev libgmp3-dev \
	linuxdoc-tools transfig texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra \
	texlive-fonts-recommended
</code>

On a judgehost, the following should be sufficient. The last line shows some
example compilers to install for C, C++, Java (GNU), Java (Oracle/Sun), Haskell
and Pascal; change the list as appropriate.

<code>
apt-get install make sudo php5-cli php5-mysql ntp xsltproc procps sharutils \
	gcc g++ gcj openjdk-6-jre-headless openjdk-6-jdk ghc fp-compiler
</code>

<sect>Installation system
<label id="install_config:installsystem">
<p>

The DOMjudge build/install system consists of a <tt>configure</tt>
script and makefiles, but when installing it, some more care has to be
taken than simply running '<tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp;
make install</tt>'. DOMjudge needs to be installed both on the server
and on the judgehosts. These require different parts of the complete
system to be present and can be installed separately. Within the build
system these parts are referred to as <tt>domserver, judgehost</tt>
and additionally <tt>docs</tt> for all documentation.


There are three different methods for installing DOMjudge:
<descrip>
<tag>Single directory tree</tag>
	With this method all DOMjudge related files and programs are
	installed in a single directory tree which is specified by the
	prefix option of configure, like
<code>
./configure --prefix=$HOME/domjudge
</code>
	This will install each of the <tt>domserver, judgehost,
	docs</tt> parts in a subdirectory
	<tt>$HOME/domjudge/domserver</tt> etc. These
	subdirectories can be overridden from the defaults with options
	like <tt>--with-domserver_root=DIR</tt>, see <tt>configure
	--help</tt> for a complete list. The prefix defaults to
	<tt>/opt/domjudge</tt>.

	Besides the installed files, there will also be directories
	for logging, temporary files, submitted sources and judging
	data:
	<descrip>
		<tag><tt>log</tt></tag> contains all log files.
		<tag><tt>tmp</tt></tag> contains temporary files.
		<tag><tt>submissions</tt></tag>
		(optionally) on the domserver contains all correctly
		submitted files: as backup only, the database is the
		authoritative source. Note that this directory must be
		writable by the web server for this feature to work.
		<tag><tt>judgings</tt></tag>
		location on judgehosts where submissions are tested,
		each in its own subdirectory. 
	</descrip>

	This method of installation is the default and probably most
	practical for normal purposes as it keeps all files together,
	hence easily found.

<tag>FHS compliant</tag>
	This method installs DOMjudge in directories according to the
	<htmlurl name="Filesystem Hierarchy Standard"
	url="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">. It can be enabled by
	passing the option <tt>--enable-fhs</tt> to <tt>configure</tt>
	and in this case the prefix defaults to <tt>/usr/local</tt>.
	Files will be placed e.g. in <tt>PREFIX/share/domjudge,
	PREFIX/bin, /var/log, /tmp, /etc/domjudge</tt>.

<tag>Maintainer install</tag>
	Meant for those wishing to do development on the DOMjudge
	source code. See the <ref id="appendix:developerinfo"
	name="appendix with developer information">.
</descrip>

After running the <tt>configure</tt> script, the system can be built
and installed. Each of the <tt>domserver, judgehost, docs</tt> parts
can be built and installed separately, respectively by:
<code>
make domserver &amp;&amp; sudo make install-domserver
make judgehost &amp;&amp; sudo make install-judgehost
make docs &amp;&amp; make install-docs
</code>
Note that even when installing e.g. in your own home directory, root
privileges are still required for domserver and judgehost
installation, because user and group ownership of password files, some
directories and to give sudo access to <tt>runguard</tt>. One should
<em>not</em> run DOMjudge programs and daemons under the root user
however, but under a normal user: <tt>runguard</tt> is specifically
designed to be the only part invoked as root (through sudo) to make
this unnecessary and running as root
will give rise to problems, see <ref id="runguard-rootprivs"
name="runguard: root privileges not dropped"> in the common problems
section.

For a list of basic make targets, run <tt>make</tt> in the source root
directory without arguments.

<sect>Configuration
<p>

Configuration of the judge system is mostly done by editing the
configuration variables on the page <tt>Configuration settings</tt>
available in the administrator interface. Changes take effect immediately.

Some settings that are tightly coupled to the filesystem can be
configured in the files in <tt>etc</tt>: <tt>domserver-config.php,
judgehost-config.php, common-config.php</tt> for the configuration
options of the domserver, judgehost and shared configuration options
respectively. The latter should be synchronised between domserver and
judgehosts. Descriptions of settings are included in these files.
The judgedaemon must be restarted for changes to take effect, while
these are directly picked up by the webinterfaces.

Besides these settings, there are a few other places where changes can
be made to the system, see <ref id="install_config:configurablescripts"
name="other configurable scripts">.


<sect>Configuration of languages
<p>

Configuration of the compilers of the supported languages should be
done separately. For each supported language a shell-script named
<tt>compile_&lt;lang&gt;.sh</tt> should be created and placed in
<tt>lib/judge</tt> on the judgehosts, where &lt;lang&gt; is the ID of
the language as specified in the database. For more information, see
for example <tt>compile_c.sh</tt>, and <tt>compile.sh</tt> in
<tt>lib/judge</tt> for syntax. Note that compile scripts are included
for the most common languages already.

Interpreted languages and non-statically linked binaries can in
principle also be used, but then the option <tt>USE_CHROOT</tt> should
be disabled (or all dependencies be added to the chroot environment).
Interpreted languages do not generate an executable and in principle
do not need a compilation step. However, to be able to use interpreted
languages (also Oracle's (Sun) Java), a script must be generated during the
compilation step, which will function as the executable: the script
must run the interpreter on the source. See <tt>compile_perl.sh</tt>
and <tt>compile_java_javac.sh</tt> in <tt>lib/judge</tt> for
examples.

DOMjudge supports the use of Oracle (Sun) Java within a chroot environment. For
this, a chroot environment which includes the Java libraries must
first be built. This can be accomplished with the included script
<tt>dj_make_chroot</tt>: run this as root and pass as arguments
the target directory to build the chroot environment in and as second
argument the target machine architecture. Start the script without
arguments for usage information. See also sections
<ref id="install_config:judgehost" name="Installation of a judgehost">
and <ref id="problems:java-chroot" name="Problems: Java & chroot">.

<sect>Configuration of special run and compare programs
<p>

To allow for problems that do not fit within the standard scheme of
fixed input and/or output, DOMjudge has the possibility to change the
way submissions are run and checked for correctness.

The back end script <tt>testcase_run.sh</tt> that handles
the running and checking of submissions, calls separate
programs for running and comparison of the results. These can be
specialised and adapted to the requirements per problem. For this, one
has to create programs or scripts named <tt>run_&lt;tag&gt;</tt> and/or
<tt>compare_&lt;tag&gt;</tt> in the <tt>lib/judge</tt>
directory, see <tt>run</tt> and <tt>compare</tt> for examples and
usage information. Then the <tt>&lt;tag&gt;</tt> must be
specified in the <tt>special_run</tt> and/or <tt>special_compare</tt>
fields of the problem (empty means that the default script run and
compare scripts should be used). To simplify the use of custom run and
compare programs, DOMjudge comes with wrapper scripts that handle the
tedious, standard part. In most cases it will probably be convenient
to use these, see <tt>run_wrapper</tt> and <tt>compare_wrapper</tt>
for details, and the usage explanations below.

<sect1>Compare programs
<p>

Implementing a special compare program, also called a
<em>validator</em>, can be done in two ways: either write a program
that is called directly (by <tt>testcase_run.sh</tt>) or use a copy of
the <tt>compare_wrapper</tt> script. In the first case, the compare
program must adhere to the <ref id="validator" name="ICPC validator
interface">. In the latter case, the wrapper generates the XML result
file and handles redirection of input/output for you. Use this
wrapper by copying it to <tt>compare_&lt;tag&gt;</tt> and let the
jury write a checker program which can be called as
<code>
check_<tag> <testdata.in> <program.out> <testdata.out>
</code>
This program should write some kind of difference to stdout. No
output results in a <em>correct</em> verdict and a nonzero exitcode in
an internal (system) error. See as an example the included program
<tt>check_float</tt>, which compares floating point numbers. The name
of the check program and any parameters can also be modified in the
<tt>compare_wrapper</tt> script.

For example, to compare output while ignoring DOS/UNIX newline
differences, one can copy <tt>compare_wrapper</tt> to
<tt>compare_dos_newline_OK</tt> and in that file set the variable
<tt>CHECK_PROGRAM="`which diff`"</tt> and replace the line
<code>
"$CHECK_PROGRAM" $CHECK_OPTIONS "$TESTIN" "$PROGRAM" "$TESTOUT" > "$DIFFOUT"
</code>
by the lines
<code>
sed -i 's/\r$//' "$TESTOUT"
sed 's/\r$//' "$PROGRAM" | $CHECK_PROGRAM -a - "$TESTOUT" > "$DIFFOUT"
</code>
Note that these commands will modify the local copy of the jury
testdata, but the original output generated by the team's solution is
retained, and a plain diff output is generated. Next, for each problem
that you want to use this validator for, set the
<tt>special_compare</tt> field to <tt>dos_newline_OK</tt>. As an
alternative to this modified validator script, one can accept
presentation errors as correct answers by adding the mapping
<code>
	'presentation-error' => 'correct',
</code>
to the <tt>results_remap</tt> configuration variable.

For more details on modifying validator scripts, see the comments at the top
of the files <tt>testcase_run.sh</tt>, <tt>compare_wrapper</tt>
and (when not using the wrapper) the appendix on the
<ref id="validator" name="ICPC validator interface">.

DOMjudge supports a <tt>presentation-error</tt> result. The default
<tt>compare</tt> program returns this result when output only differs
by whitespace; this is counted as an incorrect submission. The script
<tt>compare_wrapper</tt> does not support presentation error results
however. By default presentation errors are remapped to wrong answer;
this can be changed with <tt>results_remap</tt>.

<sect1>Run programs
<p>

Special run programs can be used, for example, to create an interactive
problem, where the contestants' program exchanges information with a
jury program and receives data depending on its own output. The
problem <tt>boolfind</tt> is included as an example interactive
problem, see <tt>docs/examples/boolfind.pdf</tt> for the description.

Usage is similar to compare programs: you can either create a program
<tt>run_&lt;tag&gt;</tt> yourself, or use the provided wrapper
script, which handles bi-directional communication between a
jury program and the contestants' program on stdin/stdout.

For the first case, the calling syntax that the program must accept is
equal to the calling syntax of <tt>run_wrapper</tt>, which is
documented in that file. When using <tt>run_wrapper</tt>, you should
copy or symlink it to another name <tt>run_&lt;tag&gt;</tt> and
the jury must write a program named exactly <tt>runjury_&lt;tag&gt;</tt>,
accepting the calling syntax
<code>
runjury_<tag> <testdata.in> <program.out>
</code>
where the arguments are files to read input testdata from and write
program output to, respectively. This program will communicate via
stdin/stdout with the contestants' program. A special compare program
must probably also be created, so the exact data written to
<tt>&lt;program.out&gt;</tt> is not important, as long as the
correctness of the contestants' program can be deduced from the
contents by the compare program.


<sect>Alerting system
<p>

DOMjudge includes an alerting system. This allows the administrator to
receive alerts when important system events happen, e.g. an error
occurs, or a submission or judging is made.

These alerts are passed to a plugin script <tt>alert</tt> which can
easily be adapted to fit your needs. The default script emits
different beeping sounds for the different messages when the
<tt>beep</tt> program is available, but it could for example also be
modified to send a mail on specific issues, connect to monitoring
software like Nagios, etc. For more details, see the script
<tt>lib/alert</tt>.

<sect>Other configurable scripts<label id="install_config:configurablescripts">
<p>

There are a few more places where some configuration of the system can
be made. These are sometimes needed in non-standard environments.
<itemize>
<item> In <tt>bin/dj_make_chroot</tt> on a judgehost some changes to
       variables can be made, most notably <tt>DEBMIRROR</tt> to
       select a Debian mirror site near you.
<item> Optional scripts <tt>submit/submit_copy.sh</tt> and
       <tt>lib/judge/chroot-startstop.sh</tt> can be modified
       to suit your local environment. See comments in those files for
       more information.
</itemize>

<sect>Submission methods <label id="install_config:submissionmethods">
<p>

DOMjudge supports two submission methods: via the command line submit
program and via the web interface. From experience, both methods have
users that prefer the one above the other.

The command line submit client can send submissions by either using
the web interface internally (<em>http</em> protocol, the default),
or using a special command line submit protocol, called
<em>Dolstra</em>. The latter has some special features but is not
usually needed. See <ref id="dolstra" name="Submitdaemon and the
Dolstra protocol"> for
details on this.

Using the http protocol with the submit client requires the libcURL
library development files at compile time (the submit client is
statically linked to libcURL to avoid a runtime dependency).

The database is the authoritative version for submission sources;
file system storage is available as an easy way
to access the source files and as backup. The program
<tt>bin/restore_sources2db</tt> is available to recover the submission
table in the database from these files. The command line daemon will
automatically store sources on the file system; the web server needs
write permissions on <tt>&lt;domjudge_submitdir&gt;</tt> and ignores
file system storage if these permissions are not set.

<sect>Database installation
<p>

DOMjudge uses a MySQL database server for information storage.

The database structure and privileges are included in MySQL
dump files in the sql subdirectory. The default database name is
<tt>domjudge</tt>. This can be changed manually in the
<tt>etc/dbpasswords.secret</tt> file: the database name as specified
in this file will be used when installing.

Installation of the database is done with <tt>bin/dj-setup-database</tt>.
For this, you need an installed and configured MySQL server and
administrator access to it. Run
<code>
dj-setup-database [-u <admin_user>] [-p <password>|-r] install
</code>
to create the database, users and insert some default/example data
into the domjudge database. The option <tt>-r</tt> will prompt for a
password; when no user is specified, the mysql client will try to read
credentials from <tt>$HOME/.my.cnf</tt> as usual. The command
<tt>uninstall</tt> can be passed to <tt>dj-setup-database</tt> to
remove the DOMjudge database and users; <em>this deletes all data!</em>

The domjudge database contains a number of tables, some of which need
to be manually filled with data before the contest can be run. See the
<ref id="contestsetup:database" name="database section of Contest
setup"> for details.

<sect1>Fine tuning settings
<p>
For Apache, there are countless documents on how to maximise performance.
Of particular importance is to ensure that the <tt>MaxClients</tt> setting
is high enough to receive the number of parallel requests you expect, but
not higher than your amount of RAM allows.

<p>
As for PHP, the use of an opcode cache like the Alternative PHP Cache
(Debian package: <tt>php-apc</tt>) is beneficial for performance.

<p>
It may be desirable or even necessary to fine tune some MySQL default settings:

<itemize>
<item><tt>max_connections</tt>: The default 100 is too low, because of the
connection caching by Apache threads. 1000 is more appropriate.
<item><tt>max_allowed_packet</tt>: The default of 16MB might be too
low when using large testcases. This should be changed both in the
MySQL server and client configuration.
<item><tt>skip-networking</tt> or <tt>bind-address</tt>: By default MySQL
only listens on a local socket, but judgehosts need to connect remotely to
it. When enabling remote connections, you may want to limit it to only the
IP's of judgehosts in the MySQL user configuration (or with firewall rules).
<item>Root password: MySQL does not have a password for the root user
by default. It's very desirable to set one.
<item>Client connection settings: client connections from the judgehosts
to the domserver are by default unencrypted. Depending on your network
setup it may be desirable to enable this. Also, enabling compression can
help when working with large testcase data.
<item>When maximising performance is required, you can
consider to use the <em>Memory</em> (formerly <em>Heap</em>) table
for the scoreboard_public and scoreboard_jury tables. They will be
lost in case of a full crash, but can be recalculated from the jury
interface.
</itemize>

<sect1>Setting up replication or backups
<p>
The MySQL server is the central place of information storage for
DOMjudge. Think well about what to do if the MySQL
host fails or loses your data.

A very robust solution is to set up a replicating MySQL server on
another host. This will be a hot copy of all data up to the second,
and can take over immediately in the event of failure. The MySQL manual
has more information about setting this up.

Alternatively, you can make regular backups of your data to another host,
for example with <tt>mysqldump</tt>, or use a RAID based system.

Replication can also be used to improve performance, by directing all
select-queries to one or more replicated slave servers, while updates
will still be done to the master. This is not supported out of the box,
and will require making changes to the DOMjudge source.

<sect>Web server configuration
<p>

For the web interface, you need to have a web server (e.g. Apache)
installed on the domserver and made sure that PHP correctly works
with it. Refer to the documentation of your web server and PHP for
details.

You should turn PHP's <tt>magic_quotes_*</tt> options off. We
also recommend to turn off <tt>register_globals</tt>.
If you want to upload large testcases in the jury web interface,
it may be necessary to raise some PHP limits or you'll get
"memory exhausted" errors. Make sure that the parameters
<tt>memory_limit</tt>, <tt>upload_max_filesize</tt> and <tt>post_max_size</tt>
in <tt>php.ini</tt> are all well above the size of your largest testcase.

To configure the web server for DOMjudge, use the Apache configuration
snippet from <tt>etc/apache.conf</tt>. It contains examples for
configuring the DOMjudge pages with an alias directive, or as a
virtualhost, optionally with SSL; it also contains PHP and security
settings. Reload the web server for changes to take effect.


<sect1>Jury authentication
<p>

Protection of the jury (and plugin) interface happens through HTTP
basic-auth configured in Apache. A default user <tt>domjudge_jury</tt>
with password equal to that in <tt>etc/dbpasswords.secret</tt> is
set at installation. You should add accounts for the individual users
(admins, judges) that will access the jury interface. These users
can be added with the <tt>htpasswd</tt> program to
<tt>etc/htpasswd-jury</tt>:
<code>
htpasswd [<path to etc>]/htpasswd-jury <username>
</code>

Individual judge accounts are needed because actions in the jury
interface, e.g. who claimed or verified a submission, are tied to
this user.

Apache supports many types of authentication backends, so it's
also possible to use LDAP, CAS, SAML (Shibboleth) or any other means,
as long as this results in a username being presented to DOMjudge.
The included <tt>apache.conf</tt> has examples.

For team authentication, see <ref id="contestsetup:authentication"
name="the relevant section in Contest Setup">.

See also section <ref id="security:webprivs" name="Security: webserver
privileges"> for some details on file permissions for the
<tt>etc/dbpasswords.secret</tt> and
<tt>etc/htpasswd-{jury,plugin}</tt> files.

<sect>Logging &amp; debugging
<p>

All DOMjudge daemons and web interface scripts support logging and
debugging in a uniform manner via functions in <tt>lib.error.*</tt>.
There are three ways in which information is logged:
<itemize>
<item>Directly to <tt>stderr</tt> for daemons or to the web page for
      web interface scripts (the latter only on serious issues).
<item>To a log file set by the variable <tt>LOGFILE</tt>, which is set
      in each program. Unsetting this variable disables this method.
<item>To syslog. This can be configured via the <tt>SYSLOG</tt>
      configuration variable in <tt>etc/common-config.php</tt>. This
      option gives the flexibility of syslog, such as remote logging.
      See the syslog(daemon) documentation for more information.
      Unsetting this variable disables this method.
</itemize>
Each script also defines a default threshold level for messages to be
logged to stderr (<tt>VERBOSE</tt>: defaults to <tt>LOG_INFO</tt> in
daemons and <tt>LOG_ERR</tt> in the web interface) and for
log file/syslog (<tt>LOGLEVEL</tt>: defaults to <tt>LOG_DEBUG</tt>).

In case of problems, it is advisable to check the logs for clues.
Extra debugging information can be obtained by setting the config
option <tt>DEBUG</tt> to a bitwise-or of the available
<tt>DEBUG_*</tt> flags in <tt>etc/common-config.php</tt>, to e.g.
generate extra SQL query and timing information in the web interface.

<!-- This needs to be cleaned up and possibly merged in other places:

<sect>Building and installing
<p>

<itemize>
<item> a password which will be set on the jury web interface.
<item> the system root password to install some programs set-uid root.
<item> the MySQL database root password to install the DOMjudge database.
</itemize>
It does also automatically generate and set passwords for the team and
public web interface: these are only used internally in the system and
are best left untouched.

There are some files/directories that have to be readable/writable by
the web server. These are:
<itemize>
<item> <tt>etc/passwords.php</tt> must be readable by the
       web server, but (best) not world readable.
<item> <tt>&lt;domserver_submitdir&gt;</tt> can optionally be set writable for the
       web server, to store websubmitted sources there (next to the
	   database), see <ref id="install_config:submissionmethods"
	   name="submission methods"> for more information.
</itemize>

See also section <ref id="security:webprivs" name="Security: webserver
privileges">.
-->

<sect>Installation of a judgehost<label id="install_config:judgehost">
<p>

A few extra steps might need to be taken to completely install and
configure a judgehost.

For running solution programs under a non-privileged user, a user has
to be added to the system(s) that act as judgehost. This user does not
need a home-directory or password, so the following command would
suffice to add a user `domjudge-run' with minimal privileges.

<!-- NOTE: update this, then also update the copy of this under chapter 2.1 -->
On RedHat:
<verb>useradd -d /nonexistent -g nobody -M -n -s /bin/false domjudge-run</verb>
On Debian:
<verb>useradd -d /nonexistent -g nogroup -s /bin/false domjudge-run</verb>

For other systems check the specifics of your useradd command.
This user must also be configured as the user under which programs run
via <tt>configure --enable-runuser=USER</tt>; the default is
<tt>domjudge-run</tt>.

<tt>Runguard</tt> needs to be able to become root for certain operations
like changing to the runuser and performing a chroot. The following lines
must be added to <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt>, replacing &lt;domjudge&gt;
with the user you intend to run the judgedaemon as, and the full path
to runguard.
<verb>
domjudge ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: &lt;path-to-runguard&gt;/runguard *
domjudge ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp -pR /dev/null ../dev/null
</verb>
There's a pregenerated <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt> snippet in
<tt>etc/sudoers-domjudge</tt>. 

When the chroot setting is enabled (default), a static POSIX shell has
to be available for copying it to the chroot environment. For Linux
i386, a static Dash shell is included, which works out of the box. For
other architectures or operating systems, a shell has to be added
manually. Then simply point the <tt>lib/sh-static</tt> symlink to this
file.

If you use the default <tt>chroot-startstop.sh</tt> script, then
the following lines must be added to <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt>:
<verb>
domjudge ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount -n -t proc --bind /proc proc
domjudge ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/umount /*/proc
domjudge ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount --bind &lt;chrootdir&gt;/*
domjudge ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount -o remount\,ro &lt;judgehost_judgedir&gt/*
domjudge ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/umount &lt;judgehost_judgedir&gt;/*
</verb>
Here the user <tt>domjudge</tt> must be replaced by the user you
intend to run the judgedaemon as, <tt>&lt;chrootdir&gt;</tt> by the path
the chroot environment was installed to and <tt>&lt;judgehost_judgedir&gt;</tt>
by the value specified in <tt>configure</tt>.
This is also in the pregenerated <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt> snippet in
<tt>etc/sudoers-domjudge</tt>. 

<sect>Building and installing the submit client
<p>

The submit client can be built with <tt>make submitclient</tt>. There
is no make target to install the submit client, as its location will
very much depend on the environment. You might e.g. want to copy it to
all team computers or make it available on a network filesystem. Note
that if the team computers run a different (version of the) operating
system than the jury systems, then you need to build the submit
client for that OS.

The submit client needs to know the address of the domserver. This
can be passed as a command line option or environment variable. The
latter option makes for easier usage. A sample script
<tt>submit_wrapper.sh</tt> is included, which sets this variable.
See that script for more details on how to set this up.

<sect1>The submit client under Windows/Cygwin
<p>

The submit client can also be built under Windows when the Cygwin
environment is installed. First the Cygwin <url name="setup.exe"
url="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe"> program must be downloaded and
installed with GCC, curl-devel and maybe some more packages included.

<p>
When Cygwin is correctly installed with all necessary development
tools, the submit binary can be created by running <tt>configure</tt>
followed by <tt>make submit.exe</tt> in the <tt>submit</tt> directory.

<sect>(Re)generating documentation and the team manual
<p>

There are three sets of documentation available under the <tt>doc</tt>
directory in DOMjudge:
<descrip>
<tag>the admin-manual</tag>
for administrators of the system (this document),
<tag>the judge-manual</tag>
for judges, describing the jury web interface and giving some general
information about this system,
<tag>the team-manual</tag>
for teams, explaining how to use the system and what restrictions
there are.
</descrip>

<p>
The team manual is only available in PDF format and must be built from
the LaTeX sources in <tt>doc/team</tt> after configuration of the
system. A prebuilt team manual is included, but note that it contains
default/example values for site-specific configuration settings such
as the team web interface URL and judging settings such as the memory
limit. We strongly recommend rebuilding the team manual to include
site-specific settings and also to revise it to reflect your contest
specific environment and rules.

<p>
Besides a standard LaTeX installation, the team manual
requires the <tt>svn</tt> and <tt>expdlist</tt> packages. These are
available in TeX Live in the <tt>texlive-latex-extra</tt> package in
any modern Linux distribution. Alternatively, you can download and
install them manually from their respective subdirectories in <url
url="http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib">.

<p>
When the <tt>docs</tt> part of DOMjudge is installed and site-specific
configuration set, the team manual can be generated with the command
<tt>genteammanual</tt> found under <tt>docs/team</tt>. The PDF
document will be placed in the current
directory or a directory given as argument. The option <tt>-w WEBBASEURI</tt>
can be passed to set the base URI of the DOMjudge webinterface; it
should end with a slash and defaults to <tt>http://example.com/domjudge/</tt>.
The following should do it on a Debian-like system:
<code>
sudo apt-get install make transfig texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended
cd .../docs/team
./genteammanual [-w http://your.location.example.com/domjudge/] [targetdir]
</code>

<p>
The team manual is currently available in two languages: English and
Dutch. We welcome any translations to other languages.

<p>
The administrator's and judge's manuals are available in PDF and HTML
format and prebuilt from SGML sources. Rebuilding these is not normally
necessary. To rebuild them on a Debian-like system, the following commands
should do it:
<code>
sudo apt-get install linuxdoc-tools make transfig texlive-latex-recommended
make -C doc/admin docs
make -C doc/judge docs
</code>


<sect>Optional features
<p>

<sect1>Source code syntax highlighting
<p>

To support coloured display of submitted source code in the jury
interface, two external classes of syntax highlighters are supported:
<url name="GeSHi" url="http://qbnz.com/highlighter"> and the
<url name="PEAR" url="http://pear.php.net">
<url name="Text_Highlighter class" url="http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Highlighter/">. DOMjudge includes a copy of GeSHi under the <tt>lib/ext/</tt> dir, but
tries to find either of those in your PHP include path. When none are
found, DOMjudge falls back to source code display without highlighting.

<sect2>GeSHi
<p>
GeSHi is included by default under the <tt>lib/ext/</tt> dir.

<sect2>PEAR Text Highlighter
<p>
If you prefer the PEAR Text Highlighter, first move away the
<tt>lib/ext/geshi</tt> directory. 
You can install the Text Highlighter system wide with the
PEAR-provided tools, like this: <tt>pear install Text_Highlighter</tt>.
Alternatively you can download the source code from the
Text_Highlighter website and unpack that under the <tt>lib/ext/</tt>
directory on the domserver. Rename the
resulting <tt>Text_Highlighter-x.y.z</tt> directory to just <tt>Text</tt>. 

<sect1>NTP time synchronisation
<p>

We advise to install an NTP-daemon (Network Time Protocol) to make
sure the time between domserver and judgehost (and team computers)
is in sync.

<sect1>The plugin web interface
<p>

Next to the public, team and jury web interfaces, DOMjudge also
provides a <em>plugin</em> web interface. This web interface is still in
beta/development so subject to change. The interface provides contest data
from DOMjudge in XML format and is meant to provide external programs
(plugins) with data on the contest. This allows for all kinds of
extensions beyond the core functionality of DOMjudge such as providing
a fancy scoreboard with more statistics, aggregation of scoreboard
data for a final presentation during the prize ceremony.

As we are still thinking about possible uses and thus the data to be
provided, the exact specification of this interface may change. Also,
we are especially interested in feedback and ideas.

There are currently two data-sets provided within the <tt>plugin</tt>
subdirectory of the DOMjudge web interface, both in XML format:
<descrip>
<tag><tt>scoreboard.php</tt></tag>
	This page provides a representation of the scoreboard.
	Additionally it includes legend tables for problems,
	languages, affiliations and team categories. It does not
	accept any arguments.
<tag><tt>event.php</tt></tag>
	This page provides a representation of events that happened
	during the contest, including submissions, judgings, contest
	state changes and general clarifications. This page accepts
	two arguments <tt>fromid</tt> and <tt>toid</tt> to limit the
	output to events with event ID in that range.
</descrip>
See these pages or the accompanying <tt>xsd</tt>-files for the exact
structure.

A nice example plugin is <url name="DOMjura" url="https://github.com/nickygerritsen/DOMjura">
by Nicky Gerritsen. This provides a graphical resolver of the
scoreboard from the freeze time until end of contest and can be used
during the final prize ceremony. It is a reimplementation of the
resolver made by Tim deBoer for the ICPC World Finals.

<sect>Upgrading
<p>

There is some support to upgrade DOMjudge to newer versions. Note that
this functionality is not extensively tested, so when you plan to
upgrade, <em>you are strongly advised to backup the DOMjudge database
and other data before continuing</em>. We also advise to check the
<tt>ChangeLog</tt> file for important changes.

Upgrading the filesystem installation is probably best done by
installing the new version of DOMjudge in a separate place and
transferring the configuration settings from the old version.

There are SQL upgrade scripts to transform the database including its
data to the layout of a newer version. The scripts can be found under
<tt>sql/upgrade</tt> and each script applies changes between two
consecutive DOMjudge versions. At the beginning of each script, a check
is performed which will let MySQL bail out with an error if it should
not be applied anymore. Note that the scripts must be applied in order
(sorted by release). These scripts can be applied by running
<tt>dj-database-setup upgrade</tt>.


<chapt>Setting up a contest <label id="contestsetup">
<p>

After installation is successful, you want to run your contest!
Configuring DOMjudge to run a contest (or a number of them, in
sequence) involves the following steps:

<itemize>
<item> Configure the contest data;
<item> Set up authentication for teams;
<item> Supply in- and output testdata;
<item> Check that everything works.
</itemize>

<sect>Configure the contest data
<label id="contestsetup:database">
<p>

DOMjudge stores and retrieves most of its data from the MySQL
database. Some information must be filled in beforehand, other tables
will be populated by DOMjudge.

You can use the jury web interface to add, edit and delete most types
of data described below. It's advised to keep a version of phpMyAdmin
handy in case of emergencies, or for general database operations like
import and export.

This section describes the meaning of each table and what you need to
put into it. Tables marked with an `x' are the ones you have to
configure with contest data before running a contest (via the jury web
interface or e.g. with phpMyAdmin), the other tables are used

Now follows a longer description (including fields) per table that has
to be filled manually. As a general remark: almost all tables have an
identifier field. Most of these are numeric and automatically
increasing; these do not need to be specified. The tables
<tt>language</tt>, <tt>problem</tt>, <tt>team</tt>, and
<tt>team&lowbar;affiliation</tt> have text strings as identifier
fields. These need to be manually specified and only alpha-numeric, dash and
underscore characters are valid, i.e. <tt>a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, &lowbar;</tt>.

<descrip>
<tag>configuration</tag>
This table contains configuration settings and is work in progress.
These entries are simply stored as <tt>name, value</tt> pairs.

<tag>contest</tag>
The contests that the software will run. E.g. a test session and the
live contest.

<tt>cid</tt> is the reference ID and <tt>contestname</tt> is a
descriptive name used in the interface.

<tt>activatetime</tt>, <tt>starttime</tt> and <tt>endtime</tt>
are required fields and specify when this contest is active and
open for submissions. Optional <tt>freezetime</tt> and
<tt>unfreezetime</tt> control scoreboard freezing. For a
detailed treating of these, see section <ref
id="contestsetup:milestones" name="Contest milestones">.

The <tt>enabled</tt> field can be unset to allow for easier editing of
contest times, as disabled contests are not checked to overlap with
other contests. A disabled contest will also not become active.

<tag>judgehost</tag>
List here the hosts that will be judging the submissions.
<tt>hostname</tt> is the (short) hostname of a machine running
the judgehost part of DOMjudge.
<tt>active</tt> indicates whether this host should judge incoming
submissions. <tt>polltime</tt> is an internally used variable to
detect whether a judgedaemon is running on the host.

<tag>language</tag>
Programming languages in which to accept and judge submissions.
<tt>langid</tt> is a string of maximum length 8, which references the
language; it is used internally as extension for source files and must
match the first extension listed for the language in
the <tt>LANG_EXTS</tt> setting in the configuration files.
This reference is also used to call the correct compile
script (<tt>lib/judge/compile_c.sh</tt>, etc.), so when adding
a new language, check that these match.

<tt>name</tt> is the displayed name of the language;
<tt>allow_submit</tt> determines whether teams can submit
using this language; <tt>allow_judge</tt> determines whether
judgehosts will judge submissions for this problem. This can for
example be set to <em>no</em> to temporarily hold judging when a problem occurs
with the judging of a specific language; after resolution of the
problem this can be set to <em>yes</em> again.

<tt>time_factor</tt> is the relative factor by which the timelimit is
multiplied for solutions in this language. For example Java is/was
known to be structurally slower than C/C++.

<tag>problem</tag>
This table contains the problem definitions. <tt>probid</tt> is the
reference ID, <tt>cid</tt> is the contest ID this problem is (only)
defined for: a problem cannot be used in multiple contests.
<tt>name</tt> is the full name (description) of the problem.

<tt>allow_submit</tt> determines whether teams can submit
solutions for this problem. Non-submittable problems are also not
displayed on the scoreboard. This can be used to define spare
problems, which can then be added to the contest quickly;
<tt>allow_judge</tt> determines whether judgehosts will judge
submissions for this problem. See also the explanation for language.

<tt>timelimit</tt> is the timelimit in seconds
within which solutions for this problem have to run (taking into
account <tt>time_factor</tt> per language).

<tt>special_run</tt> if not empty defines a custom run program
<tt>run_&lt;special_run&gt;</tt> to run compiled submissions for
this problem and <tt>special_compare</tt> if not empty defines a
custom compare program <tt>compare_&lt;special_compare&gt;</tt> to
compare output for this problem.

The <tt>color</tt> tag can be filled with a CSS colour specification
to associate with this problem; see also section <ref id="scoreboard:colours"
name="Scoreboard: colours">.

<tag>team</tag>
Table of teams: <tt>login</tt> is the account/login-name of the team
(which is referenced to in other tables as <tt>teamid</tt>) and
<tt>name</tt> the displayed name of the team. <tt>categoryid</tt> is
the ID of the category the team is in; <tt>affilid</tt> is the
affiliation ID of the team.

<tt>authtoken</tt> is a generic field used by several of the supported
authentication mechanisms to store a piece of information it needs to
identify the team. The content of the field for each of the mechanisms is:
<itemize>
<item>IPADDRESS: field contains the IP address of the team's workstation
<item>PHP_SESSIONS: contains a hash of the password that the team can log in
with
<item>LDAP: contains the LDAP name (e.g. CN) corresponding to this
DOMjudge user
</itemize>

When <tt>enabled</tt> is set to 0, the team immediately disappears from
the scoreboards and cannot use the team web interface anymore, even
when already logged in. One use case could be to disqualify a team on
the spot.

<tt>members</tt> are the names of the team members, separated by
newlines and <tt>room</tt> is the location or room of the team, both for
display only; <tt>comments</tt> can be filled with arbitrary useful
information and is only visible to the jury.
The timestamp <tt>teampage_first_visited</tt> and the <tt>hostname</tt>
field indicate when/whether/from where a team visited its team web interface.

<tag>team_affiliation</tag>
<tt>affilid</tt> is the reference ID and <tt>name</tt> the name of the
institution. <tt>country</tt> should be the 3 character 
<htmlurl name="ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 abbreviation"
url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3#Officially_assigned_code_elements">
of the country and <tt>comments</tt> is a free form field
that is displayed in the jury interface.

Both for the country and the affiliation, a logo can be displayed on
the scoreboard. For this to work, the <tt>affilid</tt> must match a
logo picture located in
<tt>www/images/affiliations/&lt;affilid&gt;.png</tt> and
<tt>country</tt> must match a (flag) picture in
<tt>www/images/countries/&lt;country&gt;.png</tt>. All
country flags are present there, named with their 3-character ISO
codes. See also <tt>www/images/countries/README</tt>. If
either file is not present the respective ID string will be printed
instead.

<tag>team_category</tag>
<tt>categoryid</tt> is the reference ID and <tt>name</tt> is a string:
the name of the category. <tt>sortorder</tt> is the order at which
this group must be sorted in the scoreboard, where a higher number
sorts lower and equal sort depending on score.

The <tt>color</tt> is again a CSS colour specification used to
discern different categories easily. See also section <ref
id="scoreboard:colours" name="Scoreboard: colours">.

The <tt>visible</tt> flag determines whether teams in this category
are displayed on the public/team scoreboard. This feature can be used
to remove teams from the public scoreboard by assigning them to a
separate, invisible category.

<tag>testcase</tag>
The testcase table contains testdata for each problem;
<tt>testcaseid</tt> is a unique identifier, <tt>input</tt> and
<tt>output</tt> contain the testcase input/output and
<tt>md5sum_input</tt>, <tt>md5sum_output</tt> their respective md5
hashes to check for up-to-date-ness of cached versions by the
judgehosts. <tt>probid</tt> is the corresponding problem and
<tt>rank</tt> determines the order of the testcases for one problem.
<tt>description</tt> is an optional description for this testcase. See
also <ref id="contestsetup:testdata" name="providing testdata">.

</descrip>

<sect>Contest milestones<label id="contestsetup:milestones">
<p>

The <tt>contest</tt> table specifies timestamps for each contest
that mark specific milestones in the course of the contest.

The triplet <em>activatetime</em>, <em>starttime</em> and <em>endtime</em>
define when the contest runs and are required fields (activatetime and
starttime may be equal).

activatetime is the moment when a contest first becomes
visible to the public and teams (potentially replacing a previous contest
that was displayed before). Nothing can be submitted yet and the
problem set is not revealed. Clarifications can be viewed and sent.

At starttime, the scoreboard is displayed and submissions are accepted.
At endtime the contest stops. New incoming submissions will be stored
but not processed; unjudged submissions received before endtime will
still be judged.

<em>freezetime</em> and <em>unfreezetime</em> control scoreboard
freezing. freezetime is the time after which the public and team
scoreboard are not updated anymore (frozen). This is meant to make the
last stages of the contest more thrilling, because no-one knows who has
won. Leaving them empty disables this feature. When using this feature,
unfreezetime can be set to automatically `unfreeze' the scoreboard at
that time. For a more elaborate description, see also section <ref
id="scoreboard:freeze" name="Scoreboard: freezing and defrosting">.

The scoreboard, results and clarifications will remain to be displayed
to team and public after a contest, until an activatetime of a later
contest passes.

All events happen at the first moment of the defined time. That is:
for a contest with starttime "12:00:00" and endtime "17:00:00", the
first submission will be accepted at 12:00:00 and the last one at
16:59:59.

The following ordering must always hold: activatetime &lt;=
starttime &lt; (freezetime &lt;=) endtime (&lt;= unfreezetime).
No two contests may have overlap: there's always at most one active
contest at any time.



<sect>Team authentication
<label id="contestsetup:authentication">
<p>

The authentication system lets domserver know which team it is dealing
with. This system is modular, allowing flexible addition of new
methods, if required. The following methods are available by default
for team authentication.

<sect1>PHP session with passwords (default)
<p>

Each team receives a password and PHP's session management is used to
keep track of which team is logged in. This method is easiest to
setup. It does require the administrator to generate passwords for all
teams (this can be done in the jury interface) and distribute those,
though. Also, each team has to login each time they (re)start their
browser. The password is stored in a salted MD5 hash in the
<tt>authtoken</tt> field in database (team table).

<sect1>IP-address based
<p>

The IP-address of a team's workstation is used as the primary means of
authentication. The system assumes that someone coming from a specific
IP is the team with that IP listed in the team table. When a team
browses to the web interface, this is checked and the appropriate team
page is presented.

This method has the advantage that teams do not have to login. A
requirement for this method is that each team computer has a separate
IP-address from the view of the domserver, though, so this is most
suitable for onsite contests and might not work with online contests
if multiple teams are located behind a router, for example.
Furthermore, with this method the command line submitclient can be
used next to the web interface submit.

There are three possible ways of configuring team IP-addresses.

<sect2>Supply it beforehand
<p>

Before the contest starts, when entering teams into the database, add
the IP that each team will have to that team's entry in the
<tt>authtoken</tt> field. When the teams
arrive, everything will work directly and without further
configuration (except when teams switch workplaces). If possible, this
is the recommended modus operandi, because it's the least hassle just
before and during the contest.

<sect2>Use one-time passwords
<p>

Supply the teams with a one time password with which to authenticate.
Beforehand, generate passwords for each team in the jury interface.
When the test session (or contest) starts and a team connects to the
web interface and have an unknown IP, they will be prompted for
username and password. Once supplied, the IP is stored and the
password is removed and not needed anymore the next time.

This is also a secure option, but requires a bit more hassle from the
teams, and maybe from the organisers who have to distribute pieces of
paper.

<em>Note:</em> the web interface will only allow a team to
authenticate themselves once. If an IP is set, a next authentication
will be refused (to avoid trouble with lingering passwords). In order
to fully re-authenticate a team, the IP address needs to be unset. You
might also want to generate a new password for this specific team.
Furthermore, a team must explicitly connect to the team interface,
because with an unknown IP, the root DOMjudge website will redirect to
the public interface.

<sect2>Set IP upon first submission
<p>

This is only possible with the
<ref id="dolstra" name="Dolstra protocol">. The advantage is that no
prior mapping needs to be configured, but the disadvantage is that
the team interface cannot be viewed until at least one submission
was made; there are also more constraints on the system.
See the section on the Dolstra protocol for details.

The <tt>authtoken</tt> field in the database contains either the
IP-address, or an MD5 hash of the one-time password if this was set
and the team has not authenticated yet.

<sect1>Using an external LDAP server
<p>

This method can be useful when you want to integrate DOMjudge into a
larger system, or already have credentials on an LDAP server
available. The <tt>authtoken</tt> field in the database must contain
the LDAP username of the DOMjudge team. Furthermore, in
<tt>etc/domserver-config.php</tt> the <tt>LDAP_*</tt> configuration
settings must be adapted to your setup. Note that multiple (backup)
servers can be specified: they are queried in order to try to
successfully authenticate. After successful authentication against the
LDAP server(s), PHP sessions are used to track login into DOMjudge.

<sect1>Fixed team authentication
<p>

This method automatically authenticates each connection to the team
web interface as a fixed, configurable team. This can be useful for
testing or demonstration purposes, but probably not for real use
scenario's.

<sect1>Adding new authentication methods
<p>

The authentication system is modular and adding new authentication
methods is fairly easy. The authentication is handled in the file
<tt>lib/www/auth.team.php</tt>. Adding a new method amounts to editing
the functions in that file to handle your specific case.


<sect>Providing testdata
<label id="contestsetup:testdata">
<p>
Testdata is used to judge the problems: when a submission run is given the
input testdata, the resulting output is compared to the reference output data.
If they match exactly, the problem is judged to be correct.
For problems with a special compare script, testdata should still be
provided in the same way, but the correctness depends on the output of the
custom compare script. Please check the documentation in
<tt>judge/compare_wrapper</tt> when using this feature.

The database has a separate table named testcase, which can be manipulated
from the web interface. Under a problem, click on the testcase link. There
the files can be uploaded. The judgehosts cache a copy based on MD5 sum, so if
you need to make changes later, re-upload the data in the web interface and
it will automatically be picked up.

Testdata can also be imported into the system from a zip-bundle on
each problem webpage. Each pair of files
<tt>&lt;path-to-file&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;.in</tt> and corresponding
<tt>*.out</tt> found in the zip-bundle will be added as testdata.
Furthermore, when the file <tt>domjudge-problem.ini</tt> exists, then
problem properties are read from that file in INI-syntax. All keys
from the problem table are supported, so an example contents could be:
<code>
probid = hello

name = Hello world!
allow_submit=false
color=blue
</code>
Testcases will be added to those already present and imported
properties will overwrite those in the database. A completely new
problem can also be imported from a zip-bundle on the problems
overview webpage; in that case, note that if the file
<tt>domjudge-problem.ini</tt> is not present, a default value is
chosen for the unmodifiable primary key <tt>probid</tt> (as well as
for the other keys).


<sect>Start the daemons
<p>

Once everything is configured, you can start the daemons.
They all run as a normal user on the system. The needed root privileges
are gained through sudo only when necessary.

<itemize>
<item> One or more judgedaemons, one on each judgehost;
<item> Optionally the balloon notification daemon.
</itemize>

<sect>Check that everything works
<p>

If the daemons have started without any problems, you've come a long
way! Now to check that you're ready for a contest.

First, go to the jury interface:
<tt>http://www.your-domjudge-location/jury</tt>. Look under all the
menu items to see whether the displayed data looks sane. Use the
config-checker under `Admin Functions' for some sanity checks on your
configuration.

Go to a team workstation and see if you can access the team page and
if you can submit solutions.

Next, it is time to submit some test solutions. If you have the default
Hello World problem enabled, you can submit some of the example sources
from under the <tt>doc/examples</tt> directory. They should give `CORRECT'.

You can also try some (or all) of the sources under
<tt>tests</tt>. Use <tt>make check</tt> to submit a variety of
tests; this should work when the submit client is available and the
default example problems are in the active contest. There's also
<tt>make stress-test</tt>, but be warned that these tests might crash
a judgedaemon. The results can be checked in the web interface; each
source file specifies the expected outcome with some explanations. For
convenience, there is also a script <tt>check-judgings</tt>; this will
automatically check whether submitted sources from the
<tt>tests</tt> directory were judged as expected. Note that a
few sources have multiple possible outcomes: these must be verified
manually.

When all this worked, you're quite ready for a contest. Or at least,
the practice session of a contest.

<sect>Testing jury solutions
<p>

Before running a real contest, you and/or the jury will want to test
the jury's reference solutions on the system.

There is no special feature for testing their solutions under
DOMjudge. The simplest approach is to submit these solutions as a
special team. This method requires a few steps and some carefulness to
prevent a possible information leak of the problemset. It is assumed
that you have completely configured the system and contest and that
all testdata is provided. To submit the jury solutions the following
steps have to be taken:
<itemize>
<item> change the contest time to make the contest currently active;
<item> setup a special team at a local computer;
<item> submit the jury solutions as that team;
<item> check that all solutions are judged as expected in the jury
       interface;
<item> revert the contest to the original times.
</itemize>
Note that while the contest time is changed to the current time,
anyone might be able to access the public or team web-interface:
there's not too much there, but on the scoreboard the number of
problems and their titles can be read. To prevent this information
leak, one could disconnect the DOMjudge server, judgehosts and the
computer used for submitting from the rest of the network.

Furthermore, you should make sure that the team you submit the
solutions as, is in a category which is set to invisible, so that it
doesn't show up on the public and team scoreboard. The sample team
"DOMjudge" could be used, as it is in the "Organisation" category,
which is not visible by default.


<chapt>Team Workstations<label id="teamworkstations">
<p>

Here's a quick checklist for configuring the team workstations. Of course,
when hosting many teams, it makes sense to generate a preconfigured account that
has these features and can be distributed over the workstations.

<enum>
<item> The central tool teams use to interact with DOMjudge is the web browser.
  <itemize>
  <item> If possible, set the Home Page to <tt>your.domjudge.location/team/</tt>
  <item> Go to the team page and check if this team is correctly identified.
  <item> If using https and a self signed certificate, add this certificate
         to the browser certificate list to prevent annoying dialogs.
  </itemize>
<item> Make sure compilers for the supported languages are installed and working.
<item> Provide teams with the command line submit client and check that it works.
<item> Make the sample in- and output data from the problem set available.
<item> Add your SSH key to their authorized_keys file, so you can always access
their account for wiping and emergencies.
<item> Check that internet access is blocked.
</enum>

<chapt>Web interface<label id="webinterface">
<p>

The web interface is the main point of interaction with the system.
Here you can view submissions coming in, control judging,
view the standings and edit data.

<sect>Jury and Administrator view
<p>

The jury interface has two possible views: one for jury members,
and one for DOMjudge administrators. The second view is the same as
the jury view, but with more features added. Which to show is decided
by using the HTTP authentication login used to access the web interface;
you can list which HTTP users are admin with the variable
<tt>DOMJUDGE_ADMINS</tt> in <tt>etc/domserver-config.php</tt>.

This separation is handy as a matter of security (jury members cannot
(accidentally) modify things that shouldn't be) and clarity (jury members
are not confused / distracted by options they don't need).

Options offered to administrators only:
<itemize>
<item>Adding and editing any contest data
<item>Managing team passwords
<item>The config checker
<item>Refreshing the scoreboard & hostname caches
<item>Rejudge 'correct' submissions
<item>Restart 'pending' judgings
</itemize>
Furthermore, some quick link menu items might differ according to
usefulness for jury or admins.

<em>A note on rejudging:</em> it is policy within the DOMjudge system
that a correct solution cannot be reverted to incorrect. Therefore,
administrator rights are required to rejudge correct or pending
(hence, possibly correct) submissions. For some more details on
rejudging, see the jury manual.


<sect>The scoreboard <label id="scoreboard">
<p>

The scoreboard is the canonical overview for anyone interested in the
contest, be it jury, teams or the general public. It deserves to get a
section of its own.

<sect1>Colours and sorting <label id="scoreboard:colours">
<p>

Each problem can be associated with a specific colour, e.g. the colour
of the corresponding balloon that is handed out. DOMjudge can display
this colour on the scoreboard, if you fill in the `color' attribute in
the `problem' table; set it to a <htmlurl name="valid CSS colour value"
url="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1#color-units"> (e.g. `green'
or `#ff0000', although a name is preferred for displaying colour
names).

It's possible to have different categories of teams participating,
this is controlled through the `team_category' table. Each category
has its own background colour in the scoreboard. This colour can be
set with the `color' attribute to a valid CSS colour value.

If you wish, you can also define a sortorder in the category table.
This is the first field that the scoreboard is sorted on. If you want
regular teams to be sorted first, but after them you want to sort both
spectator- and business teams equally, you define `0' for the regular
category and `1' for the other categories. To completely remove a
category from the public (but not the jury) scoreboard, the category
visible flag can be set to `0'.


<sect1>Starting and ending
<p>

The displayed scoreboard will always be that of the most recently
started contest. The scoreboard is never displayed for a contest that
still has to start. In other words, the scores will become visible on
the first second of a contest start time.

When the contest ends, the scores will remain to be displayed, until a
next contest starts.

<sect1>Freezing and defrosting <label id="scoreboard:freeze">
<p>

DOMjudge has the option to `freeze' the public- and team scoreboards
at some point during the contest. This means that scores are no longer
updated and remain to be displayed as they were at the time of the
freeze. This is often done to keep the last hour interesting for all.
The scoreboard freeze time can be set with the `freezetime'
attribute in the contest table.

The scoreboard freezing works by looking at the time a submission is
made. Therefore it's possible that submissions from (just) before the
freezetime but judged after it can still cause updates to the public
scoreboard. A rejudging during the freeze may also cause such updates.

If you do not set any freeze time, this option does nothing. If you
set it, the public and team scoreboards will not be updated anymore
once this time has arrived. The jury will however still see the actual
scoreboard.

Once the contest is over, the scores are not directly `unfrozen'.
This is done to keep them secret until e.g. the prize ceremony. You
can release the final scores to team and public interfaces when the
time is right. You can do this either by setting a predefined
`unfreezetime' in the contest table, or you push the `unfreeze
now' button in the jury web interface, under contests.

<sect1>Clickability
<p>

Almost every cell is clickable in the jury interface and gives
detailed information relevant to that cell. This is (of course) not
available in the team and public scoreboards, except that in the team
and public interface the team name cell links to a page with some more
information and optionally a team picture.

<sect1>Caching
<p>

The scoreboard is not recalculated on every page load, but rather
cached in the database. It should be safe for repeated reloads from
many clients. In exceptional situations (should never occur in normal
operation, e.g. a bug in DOMjudge), the cache may become inaccurate.
The jury administrator interface contains an option to recalculate a
fresh version of the entire scoreboard. You should use this option
only when actually necessary, since it puts quite a load on the
database.

<sect1>Exporting to an external website
<p>

In many cases you might want to create a copy of the scoreboard for
external viewing from the internet. The command
<tt>bin/static_scoreboard</tt> is provided just for that. It writes to
stdout a version of the scoreboard with refresh meta-tags and links to
team pages removed. This command can for example be run every minute
and the output be placed as static content on a publicly reachable
webserver.

<sect>Balloons
<p>

In many contests balloons are handed out to teams that solve a
particular problem. DOMjudge can help in this process: both a web
interface and a notification daemon are available to notify that a new
balloon needs to be handed out. Note that only one should be used at a
time.

The web based tool is reachable from the main page in the jury
interface, where each balloon has to be checked off by the person
handing it out.

For the daemon, set the BALLOON_CMD in <tt>bin/balloons</tt> to define
how notifications
are sent. Examples are to mail to a specific mailbox or to send
prints to a printer. When configured, start <tt>bin/balloons</tt>
and notification will start.

Notifications will continue even after the scoreboard is frozen,
although a warning is printed on the notification. Stop the balloons
daemon when you don't want balloons to be handed out anymore.


<chapt>Security <label id="security">
<p>

This judging system was developed with security as one of the main
goals in mind. To implement this rigorously in various aspects
(restricting team access to others and the internet, restricting
access to the submitted programs on the domjudge systems, etc...)
requires root privileges to different parts of the whole contest
environment. Also, security measures might depend on the environment.
Therefore we have decided not to implement security measures which are
not directly related to the judging system itself. We do have some
suggestions on how you can setup external security.

<sect>Considerations
<p>

Security considerations for a programming contest are a bit different
from those in normal conditions: normally users only have to be
protected from deliberately harming each other. During a contest we
also have to restrict users from cooperatively communicating,
accessing restricted resources (like the internet) and restrict user
programs running on judgehosts.

We expect that chances are small that people are trying to cheat
during a programming contest: you have to hack the system and make use
of that within very limited time. And you have to not get caught and
disqualified afterwards. Therefore passive security measures of
warning people of the consequences and only check (or probe) things
will probably be enough.

However we wanted the system to be as secure as possible within
reason. Furthermore this software is open source, so users can try to
find weak spots before the contest.

<sect>Internal security <label id="security:internal">
<p>

Internal security of the system relies on users not being able to get
to any vital data (jury input/output and users' solutions). Data is
stored in two places: in files on the DOMjudge system account and in
the SQL database.

Files should be protected by restricting permission to the relevant
directories. Database access is protected by passwords. The default
permissions allow connections from <em>all</em> hosts, so make sure you
restrict this appropriately or choose strong enough passwords.

<em>Note:</em> the database password is stored in
<tt>etc/dbpasswords.secret</tt>. This file has to be
non-readable to teams, but has to be readable to the web server to let
the jury web interface work. A solution is to make it readable to a
special group the web server runs as. This is done when using the
default configuration and installation method and when <tt>make
install-{domserver,judgehost}</tt> is run as root. The webserver group
can be set with <tt>configure --with-webserver-group=GROUP</tt> which
defaults to <tt>www-data</tt>.

Judgehosts and the domserver communicate with each other through
the MySQL protocol. By default, MySQL does not encrypt these
connections. Refer to the MySQL manual to configure SSL on client
connections; alternatively you can employ an SSH tunnel or ensure
in the network setup that these connections are separated from
the team network.

The jury web interface is protected by HTTP Authentication. These
credentials are essentially sent plain-text, so we advise to setup
HTTPS at least for the jury interface, but preferably for all web
interfaces. By default
the <tt>domjudge_jury</tt> user will be given full access. You can
choose to add more users to the file <tt>etc/htpasswd-jury</tt>. In
<tt>etc/domserver-config.php</tt> you can add these users to the list
<tt>DOMJUDGE_ADMINS</tt>. Most data-modification functions are
restricted to only users in this list. See also the judge manual for
some more details.

Secondly, the submitted sources should not be interceptable by other
teams (even though that, if these would be sent clear-text, a team
would normally need to be root/administrator on their computer to
intercept this). This can be accomplished by using HTTPS for the web
interface. The <ref id="dolstra" name="Dolstra submission method"> by
default uses SSH to send files over the network.

There are multiple authentication methods for teams, each having its
own issues to check for.

When using IP address authentication, one has to be careful that teams
are not able to spoof their IP (for which they normally need
root/administrator privileges), as they would then be able to view
other teams' submission info (not their code) and clarifications and
submit as that team.
<em>Note:</em> This means that care has to be taken e.g. that teams
cannot simply login onto one another's computer and spoof their identity.

When using PHP sessions or LDAP, authentication data is sent via HTTP,
so we strongly advise to use HTTPS in that case.


<sect>Root privileges <label id="security:rootprivs">
<p>

A difficult issue is the securing of submitted programs run by the
jury. We do not have any control over these sources and do not want to
rely on checking them manually or filtering on things like system
calls (which can be obscured and are different per language).

Therefore we decided to tackle this issue by running these programs in
a environment as restrictive as possible. This is done by setting up a
minimal chroot environment. For this, root privileges on the judgehosts
and statically compiled programs are needed. By also
limiting all kinds of system resources (memory, processes, time,
unprivileged user) we protect the system from programs which try to
hack or could crash the system.  However, a chroot environment does
not restrict network access, so there lies a possible security risk
that has to be handled separately.

<sect>File system privileges <label id="security:fileprivs">
<p>

Of course you must make sure that the file system privileges are set
such that there's no unauthorised access to sensitive data, like
submitted solutions or passwords. This is quite system dependent. At
least <tt>&lt;judgehost_judgedir&gt;</tt> should not be readable by other users
than DOMjudge.

<sect1>Permissions for the web server <label id="security:webprivs">
<p>

<!--
FIXME: check that permissions are set as laid out here, and modify
this text to say that these things are set correctly by default.
-->
Make sure that the web server serving the DOMjudge web interface pages
has correct permissions to the <tt>www, lib, etc</tt>
directory trees. The <tt>www</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> trees can safely
set to be readable and accessible. Care should be taken with the
<tt>etc</tt> dir: the <tt>domserver-{config,static}.php</tt>,
<tt>htpasswd-*</tt> and <tt>dbpasswords.secret</tt> files
should all be readable, but <tt>dbpasswords.secret</tt> and the
htpasswd files should not be
readable by anyone else. This can be done for example by setting the
<tt>etc</tt> directory to owner:group &lt;DOMjudge
account&gt;:&lt;Web server group&gt; and permissions
<tt>drwxr-x---</tt>, denying users other than yourself and the
web server group access to the configuration and password files.

If you want the web server to also store incoming submission sources on
the file system (next to the database), then <tt>&lt;domserver_submitdir&gt;</tt> must be
writable for the web server, see also <ref
id="install_config:submissionmethods" name="submission methods">.

You should take care not to serve any files over the web that
are not under the DOMjudge 'www/' directory, because they might
contain sensitive data (e.g. those under <tt>etc/</tt>). DOMjudge
comes with <tt>.htaccess</tt> files that try to prevent this, but
double-check that it's not accessible.

<sect>External security <label id="security:external">
<p>

The following security issues are <em>not</em> handled by DOMjudge,
but left to the administrator to set up.

Network traffic between team computers, domserver and the internet
should be limited to what is allowed. Possible ways of enforcing this
might be: monitor traffic, modify firewall rules on team computers or
(what we implemented with great satisfaction) put all team computers
behind a firewalling router.

Solutions are run within a restricted (chroot) environment on the
judgehosts. This however does not restrict network access, so a
team could try to send in a solution that tries to send input testdata
back to them, access the internet, etc... A solution to this problem
is to disallow all network traffic for the test user on the judgehosts.
On Linux, this can be accomplished by modifying the
iptables, adding a rule like:

<verb>
iptables -I OUTPUT -o &lt;network_interface&gt; -m owner --uid-owner &lt;testuser_uid&gt; -j REJECT
</verb>

<chapt>Common problems and their solutions <label id="problems">
<p>


<sect>Java compilers and the chroot <label id="problems:java-chroot">
<p>

Java is difficult to deal with in an automatic way. It is probably
most preferable to use Oracle (previously Sun) Java, because that's the
version contestants will be used to. The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) is
easier to deal with but may lack some features.

With the default configuration, submitted programs are run within a minimal
chroot environment. For this the programs have to be statically
linked, because they do not have access to shared libraries.

For most languages compilers support this, but for Java, this is a bit
problematic. The Oracle (Sun) Java compiler `javac' is not a real compiler:
a bytecode interpreter `java' is needed to run the binaries and thus
this cannot simply run in a chroot environment.

There are some options to support Java as a language:
<enum>
<item> One can disable the chroot environment in
       <tt>etc/judgehost-config.php</tt> by disabling <tt>USE_CHROOT</tt>.
       Disabling the chroot environment removes this extra layer of
       security against submissions that attempt to
       cheat, but it is a simple solution to getting Java to work.
<item> Next, one can build a bigger chroot environment which contains
       all necessary ingredients to let Oracle (Sun) Java work within it.
       DOMjudge supports this with some manual setup.

       First of all, a chroot tree with Java support must be created.
       The script <tt>bin/dj_make_chroot</tt> creates one from Debian GNU/Linux
       sources; run that script without arguments for basic usage
       information. Next, edit the script <tt>lib/judge/chroot-startstop.sh</tt>
       and adapt it to work with your local system and uncomment the
       script in <tt>etc/judgehost-config.php</tt>.
<item> As an alternative the <tt>gcj</tt> compiler from GNU can be
       used instead of Oracle's (Sun's) version. This one generates true machine
       code and can link statically. However a few function calls
       cannot be linked statically (see `GCJ compiler warnings' in
       this FAQ). Secondly, the static library <tt>libgcj.a</tt>
       doesn't seem to be included in all GNU/Linux distributions: at
       least not in RedHat Enterprise Linux 4.
</enum>

<sect>The Oracle (Sun) Java virtual machine (jvm) and memory limits
<p>

DOMjudge imposes memory limits on submitted solutions. These limits
are imposed before the compiled submissions are started. On the other
hand, the Oracle (Sun) jvm is started via a compile-time generated script which
is run as a wrapper around the program. This means that the memory
limits imposed by DOMjudge are for the jvm and the running program
within it. As the jvm uses approximately 300MB, this reduces the limit
by this significant amount. See <tt>judge/compile_java_javac.sh</tt>
for the implementation details.

If you see error messages of the form
<code>
Error occurred during initialization of VM
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread
</code>
or
<code>
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Could not reserve enough space for object heap
</code>
Then the problem is probably that the jvm needs more memory than what
is reserved by the Java compile script. You should try to increase the
<tt>MEMRESERVED</tt> variable in <tt>judge/compile_java.sh</tt> and
check that the configuration variable <tt>memory-limit</tt> is set
larger than <tt>MEMRESERVED</tt>.

<sect>Java class naming
<p>

Java requires a specific naming of the main class. When declaring the
main class <tt>public</tt>, the filename must match the class name.
Therefore one should <em>not</em> declare the main class public; from
experience however, many teams do so. Secondly, the Java compiler
generates a bytecode file depending on the class name. There are two
ways to handle this.

The simplest Java compile script <tt>compile_java_javac.sh</tt>
requires the main class to be named <tt>Main</tt> with method
<code>
public static void main(String args[])
</code>

The alternative (and default) is to use the script
<tt>compile_java_javac_detect.sh</tt>, which automatically detects the
main class and even corrects the source filename when it is declared
public.

When using the GNU gcj compiler, the same holds and two similar
scripts <tt>compile_java_gcj.sh</tt> and
<tt>compile_java_gcj_detect.sh</tt> are available.

<sect>GCJ compiler warnings
<p>

When using the GNU GCJ compiler for compiling Java sources, it can
give a whole lot of warning messages of the form
<verb>
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/3.2.3/libgcj.a(gc_dlopen.o)(.text+0xbc):
In function `GC_dlopen': Using 'dlopen' in statically linked
applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc
version used for linking
</verb>

These are generated because you are trying to compile statically
linked sources, but some functions can not be static, e.g. the
`dlopen' function above. These are <em>warnings</em> and can be safely
ignored, because under normal programming contest conditions people
are not allowed to use these functions anyway (and they are not
accessible within the chroot-ed environment the program is run in).

To filter these warnings, take a look at
<tt>judge/compile_java_gcjmod.sh</tt> and replace or symlink
<tt>judge/compile_java.sh</tt> by/to this file.

<sect>Error: `submit_copy.sh failed with exitcode XX'
<p>

This error can have various causes. First of all: check the
<tt>submit.log</tt> file for more complete error messages.

Assuming the default configuration where submit_copy.sh uses `scp', we
have found that shell initialisation scripts might contain statements
which generate errors: scp runs the user's default shell when copying
submission files and when the shell dies (e.g. because of not having a
terminal), the copying fails.

Another cause might be that you do not have automatic access to the
team's account (e.g. using ssh keys).

<sect>C#/mono support
<p>

Using the mono compiler and runtime for C# gives rise to similar
problems as with Java. Although the C# language has been added to
DOMjudge, there's no support yet to run it within a chroot
environment. So in that case, <tt>USE_CHROOT</tt> must be disabled.

<sect>Memory limit errors in the web interface
<p>

E.g. when uploading large testdata files, one can run into an error in
the jury web interface of the form:
<verb>
*Fatal error*: Allowed memory size of XX bytes exhausted (tried to
allocate YY bytes) in */home/domjudge/system/lib/lib.database.php*
on line *154*
</verb>
This means that the PHP engine has run out of memory. The solution is
to raise the memory limits for PHP. This can be done by either editing
<tt>etc/apache.conf</tt> and raising the <tt>memory_limit</tt>,
<tt>upload_max_filesize</tt> and <tt>post_max_size</tt> values under
the jury directory or by directly editing the global Apache or
<tt>php.ini</tt> configuration.

<sect>Compiler errors: `runguard: root privileges not dropped'
<label id="runguard-rootprivs">
<p>

<verb>
Compiling failed with exitcode 255, compiler output:
/home/domjudge/system/bin/runguard: root privileges not dropped
</verb>
When the above error occurs on submitting any source, this indicates
that you are running the <tt>judgedaemon</tt> as root user. You should
not run any part of DOMjudge as root; the parts that require it will
gain root by themselves through sudo. Either run it as yourself or,
probably better, create dedicated a user <tt>domjudge</tt> under
which to install and run everything.

Also do not confuse this with the <tt>domjudge-run</tt> user:
this is a special user to run submissions as and should also not
be used to run normal DOMjudge processes; this user is only for
internal use.


<chapt>Multi-site contests <label id="multisite">
<p>

This manual assumed you are running a singe-site contest; that is, the teams
are located closely together, probably in a single physical location. In a
multi-site or distributed contest, teams from several remote locations use the
same DOMjudge installation. An example is a national contest where teams can
participate at their local institution.

DOMjudge supports such a setup on the condition that a central installation of
DOMjudge is used to which the teams connect over the internet. It is here where
all submission processing and judging takes place. Because DOMjudge uses a web
interface for all interactions, teams and judges will interface with the system
just as if it were local.  Still, there are some specific considerations for a
multi-site contest.

Network: there must be a relatively reliable network connection between the
locations and the central DOMjudge installation, because teams cannot submit or
query the scoreboard if the network is down. Because of travelling an unsecured
network, you may want to consider HTTPS for encrypting the traffic.  If you
want to limit internet access, it must be done in such a way that the remote
DOMjudge installation can still be reached.

Team authentication: the IP-based authentication will still work as long as
each team workstation has a different public IP address. If some teams are
behind a NAT-router and thus all present themselves to DOMjudge with the same
IP-address, another authentication scheme must be used (e.g. PHP sessions).

Judges: if the people reviewing the submissions will be located remotely as
well, it's important to agree beforehand on who-does-what, using the
submissions claim feature and how responding to incoming clarification requests
is handled. Having a shared chat/IM channel may help when unexpected issues
arise.

Scoreboard: by default DOMjudge presents all teams in the same scoreboard.
Per-site scoreboards can be implemented either by using team categories or
team affiliations in combination with the scoreboard filtering option.


<chapt>DOMjudge and the ICPC validator interface standard <label id="validator">
<p>
DOMjudge supports the ICPC validator interface standard, which can be
found at: <url url="http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/doc/valistandard.html">

As short summary, this interface standard consists of two parts: the
invocation and the result interface. The invocation interface
specifies that a validator must be called as a separate executable
with at least four command line parameters:
<code>
/path/to/validator <input_data> <program_output> <reference_output> \
                   <result_file> [<extra_options>...]
</code>

The result interface specifies that <tt>result_file</tt> should be a
valid XML document containing a root element
<code>
&lt;result outcome="string1"> string2 &lt;/result>
</code>
where <tt>string1</tt> is the result reported to the judging system
and a value "accepted" indicates a correct result.

The invocation code (<tt>judge/testcase_run.sh</tt>) adheres to the
invocation interface. It passes as a 5th optional parameter to the
validator program the filename in which it expects a difference output
between the program and jury output (parameters 2 and 3 respectively).

Parsing of the result XML file (in the result interface) is done with
the `xsltproc' program, which is part of the
<url name="GNOME libxslt package" url="http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">.
<em>The exitcode of the validator program should be zero, otherwise
an internal error is generated.</em>

DOMjudge currently has two validator scripts: <tt>judge/compare</tt>
and <tt>judge/compare_wrapper</tt>. The first does a compare with a
plain diff, the second script calls an external program for checking
(e.g. <tt>judge/check_float</tt> for comparison of floating point
results). When passed a 5th parameter, this is interpreted as a
filename to which these scripts will write a comparison of the program
and jury output. Both scripts also generate XML compliant output,
which is written to the result file specified in parameter 4 and fully
complies with the validator standard.

<chapt>Submitdaemon and the Dolstra protocol <label id="dolstra">
<p>

In the default situation, teams can submit their solutions either
via browsing to the web interface, or by using the command line
submit client, which behind the scenes employs the same web
interface to actually make the submission. This setup suffices for
many environments.

The Dolstra protocol is different in that it uses a submitdaemon
running on the domserver. One advantage is that submissions can be
made before the IP address of the team is known.
This authentication is fortified by
the following process. When a client connects, it does not send the
submission file, but only a reference to a randomised and not publicly
visible file. This file is then copied from server side with the
submit_copy script. This makes it impossible for teams to spoof a
submission for a different team: the server `calls back' the team the
submitter identified himself as and checks for existence of the
advertised file. Because filenames are randomised and invisible
(within the <tt>$HOME/.domjudge</tt> directory by default), it is also
impossible for someone to guess another team's filename and submit it
for them.

The figure below is a graphical representation of the flow of a
submission. Arrows with filled lines indicate the flow of the
submission file, while dot-dash lines indicate flow of metadata about
the submission. Each line where no protocol of data transfer is given,
are just file system operations. Squares are programs and rounded
squares are storage locations.

<figure loc="h">
<eps file="submitflow.eps" height="7cm">
<img src="submitflow.png">
<caption>Submission flow diagram including Dolstra protocol.
</figure>


To have DOMjudge configure the IP upon first submission in this way,
set option <tt>STRICTIPCHECK</tt> to 0. In that case, we start out without
IP's (and the web interface will not be accessible), but as soon as a
team connects with the command line submit client <em>to the
submitdaemon</em>, they are authenticated by correctly submitting a
file and the IP is registered and everything works as normal.

The connect can happen during the test session, so during the real
contest everything is fully available. This is a secure way of
authenticating teams, which requires no passwords or IP configuration,
but teams must submit via the command line submit client to the
command line daemon before they can access their teampage.

<sect>Dolstra protocol requirements
<p>

If you want to use the Dolstra submit method (next to / instead of
the HTTP functionality) you need to satisfy the following requirements.

The submitdaemon needs to run at the domserver, and receive connections
on a configurable TCP port, default 9147.

Team accounts need to be
accessible via SSH on the domserver (a SSH public key
of the DOMjudge system account should be installed on all team accounts
to provide key-based access), and a shared filesystem (e.g. NFS)
is needed between the team computers and the domserver.
Alternatively, another means of
providing access from the server can be configured, see the file
<tt>submit/submit_copy.sh</tt> for more details.

To build the command line client under Windows, you need to have at least Windows XP and
cygwin version 1.7 for support of the complete <tt>netdb.h</tt>
headers.


<chapt>Developer information
<label id="appendix:developerinfo">
<p>

This section contains instructions specifically for those wishing
to modify the DOMjudge source. If you have any questions about
developing DOMjudge, or if you want to share your changes that
may be useful to others, please don't hesitate to contact us
through <htmlurl name="our development mailing list"
url="http://lists.a-eskwadraat.nl/mailman/listinfo/domjudge-devel">.


<sect>Maintainer mode installation
<p>

Besides the two modes of installation described in section 
<ref id="install_config:installsystem" name="Installation system">,
DOMjudge provides a special maintainer mode installation.
This method does an in-place installation within the source
tree. This allows one to immediately see effects when modifying
code.

This method requires some special steps which can most easily
be run via makefile rules as follows:
<code>
make maintainer-conf [CONFIGURE_FLAGS=&lt;extra options for ./configure&gt;]
make maintainer-install
</code>
Note that these targets have to be executed <em>separately</em>.

<sect>Bootstrapping from Git repository sources
<p>

The installation steps in this document assume that you are using a
downloaded tarball from the DOMjudge website. If you want to install
from Git repository sources, because you want to use the bleeding edge
code or consider to send a patch to the developers, the
configure/build system first has to be bootstrapped.

This requires
additional software to be installed:
<itemize>
<item> The GNU autoconf/automake toolset

<item> Flex and <htmlurl name="bisonc++"
       url="http://bisoncpp.sourceforge.net/"> for generating the
       parsing code of the optional <tt>checktestdata</tt> script.

<item> Linuxdoc and Xfig/transfig to build the admin and judge
       documentation from SGML sources and a LaTeX installation to
       generate the PDF admin, judge and default team manual.
</itemize>

On Debian(-based) systems, the following apt-get command should
install the additionally required packages (next to the
<ref id="install_config:apt-getinstall"
       name="standard set of packages">):
<code>
apt-get install autoconf automake flex bisonc++ linuxdoc-tools transfig
</code>

When this software is present, bootstrapping can be done by running
<tt>make dist</tt>, which creates the <tt>configure</tt> script and
generates documentation from SGML/LaTeX sources. 

<sect>Makefile structure
<p>

The Makefiles in the source tree use a recursion mechanism to run make
targets within the relevant subdirectories. The recursion is handled
by the <tt>REC_TARGETS</tt> and <tt>SUBDIRS</tt> variables and the
recursion step is executed in <tt>Makefile.global</tt>. Any target
added to the <tt>REC_TARGETS</tt> list will be recursively called in
all directories in <tt>SUBDIRS</tt>. Moreover, a local variant of the
target with <tt>-l</tt> appended is called after recursing into the
subdirectories, so recursion is depth-first.

The targets <tt>dist, clean, distclean, maintainer-clean</tt> are
recursive by default, which means that these call their local
<tt>-l</tt> variants in all directories containing a Makefile. This
allows for true depth-first traversal, which is necessary to correctly
run the <tt>*clean</tt> targets: otherwise e.g. <tt>paths.mk</tt> will
be deleted before subdirectory <tt>*clean</tt> targets are called that
depend on information in it.
