Appendix: Configuration reference
=================================

DOMjudge has several configuration settings available. They can be accessed in
the admin interface under *Configuration settings*. This appendix contains a
list of all the available options with a description of what they mean.

The system has the following types of configuration options:

* ``bool``: a boolean, either ``true`` or ``false``.
* ``int``: a numeric value.
* ``string``: a string value.
* ``array_val``: an array of values.
* ``array_keyval``: an array of values with specific keys (also known as a dictionary).

**Public** means whether the option is exposed in the API to non-jury members.
