<chapt>DOMjudge overview <label id="overview">
<p>

DOMjudge is a system for running programming contests, like the ACM
ICPC regional and world championship programming contests.

This means that teams are on-site and have a fixed time period (mostly
5 hours) and one computer to solve a number of problems (mostly 6-10).
Problems are solved by writing a program in one of the allowed
languages, that reads input according to the problem input
specification and writes the correct, corresponding output.

The judging is done by submitting the source code of the solution to
the jury. There the jury system automatically compiles and runs the
program and compares the program output with the expected output.

This software can be used to handle the submission and judging during
such contests. It also handles feedback to the teams and communication
on problems (clarification requests). It has web interfaces for the
jury, the teams (their submissions and clarification requests) and the
public (scoreboard).

<sect1>About the name and logo
<p>

The name of this judging system is inspired by a very important and
well known landmark in the city of Utrecht: the dome tower, called the
`Dom' in Dutch. The logo of the 2004 Dutch Programming
Championships (for which this system was originally developed) depicts
a representation of the Dom in zeros and ones. We based the name and
logo of DOMjudge on that.

We would like to thank Erik van Sebille, the original creator of the
logo. The logo is under a GPL licence, although Erik first suggested a
"free as in beer" licence first: you're allowed to use it, but you owe
Erik a free beer in case might you encounter him.
