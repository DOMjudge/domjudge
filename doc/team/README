DOMjudge team manual
--------------------

The manual for teams automatically incorporates DOMjudge configuration
items. Therefore it is not pre-built, but should be built after you
have configured your system, so teams get the correct information. The
manual can be generated with the 'genteammanuals' command located
under the 'team' subdirectory. Pass the output directory as argument.

As many things are configurable, we advise to redact the manual to your
specific situation, e.g. by removing unused/disabled features, before
distributing them to the teams. See section 2.16 of the admin-manual for
instructions on rebuilding the team documentation.
