# This service can be called e.g. as:
#   systemctl start domjudge-judgedaemon@0.service
# to start a judgedaemon bound to CPU core 0.
#
# This way, multiple judgedaemon instances can be run on a single
# machine. Note that each instance will need a separate user
# @RUNUSER@-0, @RUNUSER@-1, etc. You can start these as a
# group using the domjudge-judgedaemons.target system unit file.
