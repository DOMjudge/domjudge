# Script to setup chroot environment extras needed for non-statically
# compiled languages, such as Java, Python and other interpreted languages.
#
# The basic chroot environment contains nothing but a POSIX shell.
# This script will (bind) mount a minimal set of subdirectories from a
# pre-built chroot tree into the actual chroot environment that is
# created for each judging (as well as the proc FS and a few device
# files). Afterwards it is also called to cleanup.
#
# You can adapt this script to your environment, e.g. if you need to make
# more/other subdirectories available in the chroot environment.
#
# See also bin/dj_make_chroot.sh for a script to generate a minimal
# chroot environment with Java included. Note that if you modify paths
# in this script, then the associated sudo rules (see
# etc/sudoers-domjudge) must also be updated.
#
# This script will be called from judgedaemon.main.php in the root
# directory of the chroot environment with one parameter: either
# 'start' to setup, or 'stop' to destroy the chroot environment.
#
# We always use 'sudo -n <command> < /dev/null' to make sure that sudo
# doesn't try to ask for a password, but just fails.

# Exit on error:
