# Global config file for system-wide configuration options
# $Id$

#########################################################################
# This file contains (almost) all configuration options of the DOMjudge
# jury system. Make changes here and then run 'make' in this directory
# to generate all language specific configuration files from this global
# configuration file and the language specific templates.
#
# Note that there might be some specific configuration options in the
# templates and also some things you might want to change in the compiler
# scripts in judge/compile_<lang>.sh and the submission copy script in
# submit/submit_copy.sh. See those scripts for more information.
#########################################################################

#########################################################################
# This file has the following syntax:
#
# Lines with only whitespace or starting with '#' are ignored.
# Declaration of configuration entries is as follows:
#
# VARNAME[ATTRIBUTES]=VALUE
#   or
# VARNAME=VALUE
#
# Where VARNAME must consist entirely of (upper- or lowercase)
# letters, digits and underscores, so [A-Za-z0-9_] and the first
# character must be a letter.
#
# VALUE can be anything, including whitespace: all characters will be
# included in VALUE from '=' until end of line.
#
# ATTRIBUTES is a comma-separated list of keywords, which can be one
# or more of the following:
#
# eval          Evaluate VALUE as a bash-shell expression. All previously
#               defined variables will be available as bash variables.
# string        Treat VALUE as a string expression, enclosing it in quotes
#               where necessary.
