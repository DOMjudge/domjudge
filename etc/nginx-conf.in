# always include this and make sure it points to the socket of PHP-FPM
upstream domjudge {

# Fall back to the internal $https variable if not set

### http host config ###
#

server {
	listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;

	# If you are reading from the event feed, make sure this is large enough.
	# If you have a slow event feed reader, nginx needs to keep the connection
	# open long enough between two write operations
	send_timeout 36000s;
	include @domserver_etcdir@/nginx-conf-inner;
}

# Alternatively, use HTTPS and redirect HTTP to HTTPS:

# server {
# 	listen   80;
# 	listen   [::]:80;
# 	server_name _default_;
# 	return 308 https://$host$request_uri;  # enforce https
# }

# Or block all cleartext HTTP requests
# server {
# 	listen   80;
# 	listen   [::]:80;
# 	server_name _default_;
# 	return 426;  # do not allow plain HTTP
# }

# server {
# 	listen   443 ssl http2;
# 	listen   [::]:443 ssl http2;

    # See https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/ to generate good TLS settings for your server

# 	ssl_session_timeout 5m;
# 	ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

	# Strict-Transport-Security is not set by default since it will break
	# installations without a valid TLS certificate. Enable it if your
	# DOMjudge installation only runs with a valid TLS certificate.
