This is the Programming Contest Jury System "DOMjudge" version 3.0.0RC2

DOMjudge is a system for running a programming contest, like the ACM
regional and world championship programming contests.


Documentation
-------------

For more information on installation and requirements see the
documentation under the doc/admin directory. There are HTML and PDF
versions of the documentation available, prebuilt from SGML sources.

The doc/ directory also contains documentation for users of DOMjudge,
namely for jury members (under doc/judge) and teams (under doc/team).

The jury documentation is also available in HTML and PDF format.

The team documentation is _not_ available prebuilt: DOMjudge has to be
properly configured first, as parts of the configuration are used in
it (e.g. the URL to the team interface of DOMjudge). A LaTeX
installation including the packages `svn` and `expdlist` is required
to build the PDF format team documentation. For more information, see
the administrator documentation.

All documentation is also available online at the DOMjudge homepage:
	http://domjudge.sourceforge.net/#documentation
Please note that this documentation is from the daily generated
snapshot and thus might not apply to your version.
