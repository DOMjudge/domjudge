int execute(const std::string& cmd, const std::vector<std::string>& args,
            std::array<int, 3>& stdio_fd, bool err2out);
/* Execute a subprocess using fork and execvp and optionally perform
 * IO redirection of stdin/stdout/stderr.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * const std::string& cmd                command to be executed (PATH is searched)
 * const std::vector<std::string>& args  vector of arguments to command
 * std::array<int, 3>& stdio_fd          File descriptors for stdin, stdout and stderr respectively.
 *      Each can separately be set to one of the following:
 *        FDREDIR_NONE - don't do redirection
 *        FDREDIR_PIPE - connect to pipe and set value to file
 *                       descriptor of other end of the pipe
 *        fd >= 0      - make this a duplicate of <fd>
 * bool err2out                          Set to true to redirect command stderr to stdout. When set
 *                                       the redirection of stderr by stdio_fd[2] is ignored.
 *
 * Returns:
 * On errors from system calls -1 is returned: check errno for extra information.
 * On internal errors -2 is returned.
 *
 * When no redirection is done (except for err2out) waits for the command to
 * finish and returns exitcode (or bash like exitcode on abnormal program
 * termination.
 *
 * When redirection is done, returns immediately after starting the command
 * with the process-ID of the child command.
