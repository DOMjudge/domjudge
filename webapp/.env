# In all environments, the following files are loaded if they exist,
# the later taking precedence over the former:
#
#  * .env                contains default values for the environment variables needed by the app
#  * .env.local          uncommitted file with local overrides
#  * .env.$APP_ENV       committed environment-specific defaults
#  * .env.$APP_ENV.local uncommitted environment-specific overrides
#
# Real environment variables win over .env files.
#
# DO NOT DEFINE PRODUCTION SECRETS IN THIS FILE NOR IN ANY OTHER COMMITTED FILES.
#
# Run "composer dump-env prod" to compile .env files for production use (requires symfony/flex >=1.2).
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/configuration.html#infrastructure-related-configuration

### DOMjudge specific settings ###

# Default to run in production mode. Change to 'dev' or create
# .env.local with contents 'APP_ENV=dev' to run the application
# in development mode.
APP_ENV=prod

# Note that APP_SECRET and DATABASE_URL are loaded by
# webapp/config/load_db_secrets.php from files in /etc and need not be
# declared here. *If* you do, they will override those loaded settings.
